## What is Literary Theory

Literary theory is the `practice` of theoretical, methodological, and sociological reflection that accompanies the reading and interpretation of literary texts; it investigates the conceptual foundations of textual scholarship, the **dynamics of textuality**, the relations between literary and other texts, and the categories and social conditions through which our engagement with texts is organized. If the study of literary texts produces a kind of knowledge, it asks what kind of knowledge that is and on what grounds its claim to authority and distinctiveness might be based.

> The **dynamics of textuality** refers to the ways in which texts function, evolve, and interact within cultural, linguistic, and interpretive contexts. It explores the active and fluid processes by which meaning is generated, negotiated, and transformed in texts over time and across different readers or audiences. This concept includes considerations of how texts relate to their form, structure, intertextual connections, and the sociocultural factors that shape their creation and reception.

For example:

- **Intertextuality**: How a text references, builds upon, or interacts with other texts.
- **Reader Response**: How the meaning of a text changes depending on the perspective or background of the reader.
- **Cultural Context**: How historical, political, or social factors influence the interpretation of a text.
- **Fluidity of Meaning**: How the meaning of a text can shift over time or across different interpretive communities.

This idea challenges static views of texts, emphasizing their role as dynamic entities shaped by ongoing dialogue and interpretation.

Since around the turn of the century literary studies has turned against the “high theory” moment of the previous three decades, and more generally against its privileged model of textuality or of cultural or linguistic mediation. It has also been marked by a structural reaction against the dominance of the US academy and toward a recognition of “world” literature. The effect of these shifts has been the development of new forms of engagement with theory: a new pragmatism; ethical criticism; affect theory; the critique of critique; the “new materialism”; the rise of ever more fine-grained forms of identity politics; the rise of new models of formalism and new models of political engagement; and a return to or reinvention of poetics or rhetoric.[^orec]



Reading is a complex and potentially almost unlimited activity.

Literary theory vs. Philosophy

Literary theory asks fundamental questions and also at times builds systems.
