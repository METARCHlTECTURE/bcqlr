## Primaeval Literature

Ancient literature is the foundation of global storytelling and cultural expression, dating back to the earliest civilizations.

**Time Period**: the embryonic stage of civilization, typically 3500 BCE - 500 BCE.

**Location**: Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, India, Greece, etc.

**Characteristics**:
1. **Oral Origins**: Many works were initially preserved through oral storytelling before being transcribed.  
2. **Religious and Mythological Roots**: Dominated by sacred texts, creation myths, and stories of gods and heroes.  
3. **Epic Narratives**: Long-form poetry or prose celebrating heroic deeds and cultural ideals.  
4. **Symbolism**: Heavy use of allegory and symbolism to convey moral, spiritual, and philosophical ideas.  
5. **Didactic Purpose**: Aimed to instruct on morality, cultural norms, and societal values. 

**Themes**:
1. **Humanity and Divinity**: Explores relationships between humans and gods, fate, and divine intervention (e.g., *The Epic of Gilgamesh*).  
2. **Mortality and Immortality**: Questions of life, death, and the afterlife (*The Book of the Dead*, *Bhagavad Gita*).  
3. **Heroism and Virtue**: Celebrates the ideals of courage, loyalty, and sacrifice (*The Iliad*, *Mahabharata*).

It is often seen as a miraculous act that changes the course of events, either for the benefit of individuals, communities, or even entire nations.

### Mesopotamian Literature

#### *Epic of Gilgamesh* (Sumerian)

The *Epic of Gilgamesh* [ˈɡɪlɡəmɛʃ] is one of the oldest and most significant pieces of literature in the world, originally written in Akkadian on 12 tablets and preserved in the library of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh. It reflects the beliefs, values, and worldview of ancient Mesopotamians.

![The Epic of Gilgamesh](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/British_Museum_Flood_Tablet.jpg/440px-British_Museum_Flood_Tablet.jpg)

**Location**: Mesopotamia  
**Written in**: c. 2100–1200 BCE  
**Happened in**: around 2100 BCE  
**Form**: Epic  
**Style**: grand, elevated  
**Protagonist**: Gilgamesh, the King of Uruk  
**Main Theme**: friendship, the search of immortality, mortality, the role of the gods.  
**Narrator**: Third-Person Omniscient Narrator  
**Narrative Structure**: The epic follows a relatively linear narrative with a clear progression of events. It also possesses non-linear elements, such as Gilgamesh’s dreams (which appear as omens), flashbacks to prior events.

##### Plot Summary
  - **Oppressive King Gilgamesh**: Gilgamesh, King of Uruk, is two-thirds god and one-third man, and mortal. His people cry out to the gods for protection, as Gilgamesh has a habit of taking whatever woman he wants, married or not, and forcing the men of his city into battles or construction on grand buildings.
  - **The Birth of Enkidu**: The gods answer their prayers by creating out of clay a man in equal strength to Gilgamesh. This wild man, who lives with wild animals and is named Enkidu, attracts attention when he uproots traps belonging to a local hunter. The hunter sends Shamhat, a temple prostitute, to seduce Enkidu, as he believes this will tame him. Enkidu has sex with her for seven days straight, after which time the animals will no longer approach him, because he is no longer one of them. She suggests that he join with civilization. Gilgamesh, meanwhile, has been dreaming about meeting a new companion.
  - **Enkido's fight with Gilgamesh**: Enkidu has been working as a shepard (shepherd), protecting the livestock of a small village, when he hears of how Gilgamesh rapes women on their wedding day. Furious, he leaves for Uruk, and when Gilgamesh tries to enter the wedding chamber he is blocked by Enkidu, and the two fight. However, upon realizing each other's strength, they decide instead to be friends.
  - **Journey to Cedar Forest**: Gilgamesh proposes that the two travel to the Cedar Forest to slay the demi-god Humbaba. Though the elders and Enkidu disagree with this idea, Gilgamesh cannot be persuaded. Gilgamesh's mother, the goddess Ninsun, offers her blessing for the adventure, and adopts Enkidu as her child, making he and Gilgamesh brothers. Ninsun seeks the protection of the sun god for her sons and is left instructions on governing the city for the duration of their travels. 
  - **Killing Humbaba**: The pair travels to the Cedar Forest and perform a dream ritual. Gilgamesh has five dreams of the mountain falling, storms, and other calamities. Enkidu interprets these as good omens, and the two fight Humbaba, aided by Shamash, the sun god. When he is nearly slain, Humbaba begs for his life. Gilgamesh hesitates, but Enkidu angrily urges him to finish off the demi-god, which Gilgamesh does. The two cut down the forbidden cedar trees Humbaba had been guarding, setting aside one to be used as the door to a new temple, and the rest are made into a raft the two use to return home.
  - **Spurning Ishtar's Advance**: Gilgamesh attracts the attention of Ishtar, the goddess of fertility, but he rejects her, as her lovers often meet ill fates. She asks her father to release the Bull of Heaven on the lands as punishment. He refuses, but she threatens to raise the dead and have them overrun the world of the living, so he relents. However, the Bull of Heaven is also slain by Gilgamesh and Enkidu, enraging the goddess further.
  - **The Death of Enkido**: Because the two have killed Humbaba and the Bull of Heaven in defiance of the gods, the gods decide one of them must die, and Enkidu is marked for death. He wanders out of the city, weakens gradually, dreaming of the Angel of Death dragging him to the afterlife, a world where souls crawl on their bellies and eat dust. Enkidu eventually dies, upset that he was not granted a magnificent death in battle. 
  - **A Visit to Utnapishtim**: Gilgamesh, mad with grief and now terrified of his own mortality, dons animal skins and sets off into the wilderness. He attempts to find Utnapishtim, the Mesopotamian Noah who survived the Great Flood by building a great ark and taking his family and livestock aboard. He was given immortality by the gods. Two scorpion monsters allow Gilgamesh to pass through the path to Utnapishtim after learning of his divine ancestry. After travelling in darkness through the path, he arrives at a beautiful garden by the sea. He speaks with the goddess Siduri at her tavern, and she attempts to dissuade him from his quest for immortality, saying that immortality would leave humankind unable to appreciate any pleasures of the world. When he will not be dissuaded, she gives him directions to Urshanabi, the ferryman. Urshanabi takes Gilgamesh across the sea to meet Utnapishtim.
  - **Utnapishtim's Story**: Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh the story of the Great Flood, how the gods decided to flood the world and eradicate mankind. However, Ea, the god of wisdom, warns Utnapishtim of the flood and instructs him to build an arc and take his family and livestock aboard. The gods regret flooding the world and vow to never wipe out humanity. Utnapishtim was granted immortality by the gods as a reward for his faith. 
  - **The failure of immortality**: When Gilgamesh insists that he too be able to live forever, Utnapishtim gives him a test; if Gilgamesh is worthy of eternal life, he should be able to stay away for a week. Gilgamesh falls asleep, however. Utnapishtim orders him to clean himself, dresses him in royal robes, and sends him back to Uruk. However, Utnapishtim's wife convinces him to tell Gilgamesh about an underwater plant which will restore youth. Gilgamesh takes the plant by anchoring himself to large rocks to help him sink to the bottom of the water. Gilgamesh intends to use it on the elders of Uruk, and eventually, himself. However, as he lies sleeping on his return travels, a snake steals the plant. 
  - **Ending**: Gilgamesh returns to Uruk without the plant and resigns himself to his mortality. He sees the city of Uruk as a beautiful achievement, one that will last ages, which is a form of immortality in and of itself, as it continues to serve the human race which will never die out.

##### Symbolism in The Epic of Gilgamesh:
  - **The Walls of Uruk**: The walls that Gilgamesh builds around Uruk are a powerful symbol of human achievement and legacy. They represent civilization's triumph over chaos and the natural world. By focusing on creating these walls, Gilgamesh attempts to make his mark on history, compensating for his inability to achieve immortality. In a way, these walls symbolize the tension between the mortal and the eternal—structures built by humans can endure, even if humans themselves cannot.
  - **The Cedar Forest**: The journey to the Cedar Forest, where Gilgamesh and Enkidu battle Humbaba, is laden with symbolism. The forest represents a place of the unknown and the sacred, where nature’s power and divinity are concentrated. In cutting down the trees and killing Humbaba, Gilgamesh and Enkidu defy the natural order, angering the gods and setting in motion a chain of events that lead to Enkidu’s death. The forest can be seen as a symbol of the untamed forces of nature that humans cannot control, no matter how strong they may be.
  - **The Bull of Heaven**: The Bull of Heaven, sent by the goddess Ishtar to punish Gilgamesh after he rejects her advances, symbolizes divine wrath. Its slaying by Gilgamesh and Enkidu represents human defiance against the gods. This act of rebellion highlights the relationship between humans and deities: while gods hold immense power, humans are not entirely powerless in their interactions with the divine.
  - **The Journey and the Search for Immortality**: Gilgamesh’s journey to find immortality is symbolic of the human condition. It represents the quest for meaning in life and the desire to transcend the limitations of mortality. Ultimately, Gilgamesh learns that immortality is an illusion, and his acceptance of death signifies a profound transformation in his character. The journey is not just external but internal as well, showing his maturation from a reckless, arrogant king to a wise ruler.

##### Key Themes
  - **Immortality**: Gilgamesh’s quest for immortality is central to the epic, and it’s a direct confrontation with the reality of human mortality. The narrative suggests that while immortality might be desirable, it is an unattainable and ultimately unnecessary goal. Utnapishtim, who has lived forever, reveals that immortality does not bring happiness or fulfillment—it’s just another form of existence, disconnected from the joy of life. The epic’s message about death is poignant: it is part of life and must be embraced, rather than feared or fought against.
  - **Friendship**: The bond between Gilgamesh and Enkidu is the emotional heart of the epic. Through their friendship, Gilgamesh learns the importance of sharing experiences and being humble. Before Enkidu, Gilgamesh was a tyrant, ruling with strength and arrogance. After Enkidu’s death, Gilgamesh is devastated and embarks on his quest for immortality, not just to escape death, but to understand its meaning.
  - **The Gods and Divine Will**: The gods in The Epic of Gilgamesh are capricious, powerful, and often petty. They intervene in human affairs with their own motives and desires. For example, Ishtar sends the Bull of Heaven to punish Gilgamesh when he spurns her, while Shamash (the sun god) aids Gilgamesh and Enkidu in their fight against Humbaba.  
  The gods’ involvement in the lives of mortals underscores the idea that fate is often beyond human control. Even the mightiest heroes, like Gilgamesh, are subject to the will of the gods. This reflects the Mesopotamian worldview that human life is fragile and subject to the whims of higher powers.

##### Historical Significance and Later Influence
  - One of the oldest and most significant pieces of literature in the world.
  - A foundational work in religion and the tradition of heroic sagas.
  - Forming the prototype for later heroes like Heracles.
  - Influenced many other works of literature, including the *Iliad*, *Odyssey*, and even modern works like *Paradise Lost*.
  - Various themes, plot elements, and characters in the *Hebrew Bible* have been suggested to correlate with the Epic of Gilgamesh – notably, the accounts of the Garden of Eden, the advice from Ecclesiastes, and the Genesis flood narrative.
  - In the *Alexander Romance* and many subsequent legends of Alexander the Great, Alexander is on a quest to find the Fountain of Life and become immortal. This was inspired by myths of Gilgamesh's quest for eternal youth in the face of his mortality
  -  Hayao Miyazaki's 1997 anime film Princess Mononoke is partially based on the Cedar Forest episode of The Epic of Gilgamesh.
