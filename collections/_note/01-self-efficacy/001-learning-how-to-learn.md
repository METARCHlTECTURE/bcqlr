## Basics

2 ways of thinking:
  - Focused mode
  - Diffuse mode

Procrasination & Pomodoro

Memory:
1. Practice makes memory permanent
2. 2 types of memory systems: long term memory & working memory
  - To build long term memory: spaced(periodly) repetition
  - Human has only 4 slots of working memory

## Chunks

WHAT ARE CHUNKS:
  - Compact packages of information that human's mind can easily access.
  - A network of neurons that are used to firing together
  - HELPS `unite` bits of information together through `meaning`.
  - The path to expertise is built little by little, small chunks can become larger. And all of the expertise serves to underpin more creative interpretations as you gradually become a master of the material.

To build chunks:
  - Focused practice and repetition, the creation of strong memory traces helps to create chunks. Focusing attention to connect parts of the brain to tie together ideas helps one started in creating a chunk.
    - These doen's work right when angry, stressed, depressed.
  - Human's attention helps make connectionsd to information in various part through 4 slots of working memory.

### 1.1 Introduction to the Focused and Diffuse Modes

What do you do when you just can't figure something out? For zombies, it's pretty simple. They can just keep bashing their brains against the wall. But living brains are a lot more complex. It turns out, though, that if you understand just a little bit of some of the basics about how your brain works, you can learn more easily and be less frustrated. **Researchers have found that we have two fundamentally different modes of thinking. Here, I'll call them the Focused and the Diffuse modes.** We're familiar with focusing. It's when you concentrate intently on something you're trying to learn or to understand. But we're not so familiar with diffuse thinking. Turns out that this more relaxed thinking style is related to a set of neural resting states.

当你遇到问题无法解决时该怎么办？对于僵尸来说，这很简单，它们可以不断用脑袋撞墙。但活人的大脑要复杂得多。不过，如果你了解一点大脑如何运作的基础知识，你就能更容易学习，并减少挫折感。**研究人员发现我们有两种根本不同的思维模式。我这里称它们为“`专注模式`”和“`发散模式`”**。我们对专注模式比较熟悉，就是当你集中精力去学习或理解某件事情时的状态。但我们对发散思维不太熟悉。事实证明，这种较为放松的思维方式与一组神经的静息状态有关。

We're going to use an analogy of the game of pinball to help us understand these two thinking modes. Incidentally, **both metaphor and analogy are really helpful when you're trying to learn something new**. If you remember, a pinball game works by, you pull back on the plunger, release it, and a ball goes boinking out, bouncing around on the rubber bumpers, and that's how you get points. So, here's your brain, with the ears right here, and the eyes looking upwards. And we can lay that pinball machine right down inside it. So, there you go. There's the analogy for the focused mode. The blue bumper bumpers here are placed very close to one another. See this orange pattern here towards the top? It represents a familiar thought pattern. Maybe involving something simple like adding some numbers, or more advanced ideas like literary criticism or calculating electromagnetic flows. You think a thought, boom, it takes off, moves smoothly along. And then, as it's bouncing around on the bumpers, you're able to figure out the problem you're trying to solve, or the concept you're trying to understand that's related to something you're rather familiar with. So look at how that thought moves smoothly around on the fuzzy underlying orange neural pathway. In some sense it's as if it's traveling along a familiar, nicely paved road.

我们将用弹球游戏来帮助理解这两种思维模式。顺便说一下，**`比喻`和`类比`在学习新事物时非常有帮助**。你还记得弹球游戏是怎么工作的吗？你拉下弹簧，然后释放，弹球便会弹出，在橡胶挡板之间四处弹跳，这样你就能得分。那么，现在把这个类比应用到你的大脑里，耳朵在这儿，眼睛向上看。我们可以把这个弹球机放到大脑里。所以，专注模式的类比就是这个。蓝色的挡板靠得非常近。你看到上面的橙色路径了吗？它代表了一个熟悉的思维模式，可能是关于一些简单的事物，比如加法运算，或者更高级的想法，比如文学评论或电磁流的计算。**你一思考，想法就启动了，顺利地在挡板之间跳动，然后当它弹跳时，你就能够解决你试图解决的问题，或理解与你熟悉的内容相关的概念**。看这条想法如何顺畅地沿着模糊的橙色神经通路移动。在某种意义上，**它就像是在一条熟悉的、铺好的道路上行驶一样**。

But what if the problem you're working on needs new ideas or approaches? Concepts you haven't thought of before. That's symbolized here by this neural pattern towards the bottom of the pinball machine area. But if you haven't thought that thought before, you don't even know how that pattern feels or where it is. So how are you going to develop that new thought in the first place? **Not only do you not know where the pattern is or what the pattern looks like, but see all the rubber bumpers that are blocking your access whatever direction you do decide to move in?** To get to this new thought pattern, you need a different way of thinking. And that's represented here, by the `diffuse mode`. Look at how widely spaced the rubber bumpers are. Thought takes off, look at how it moves widely, bounces around. It could travel a long way before being interrupted by hitting a bumper. In this diffuse mode of thinking, you can **look at things broadly from a very different, big picture perspective**. You can **make new neural connections traveling along new pathways**. You can't focus in as tightly as you often need to, to finalize any kind of problem solving. Or understand the finest aspects of a concept. But you can at least get to the initial place you need to be in to home in on a solution.

但是，如果你正在处理的问题需要新的想法或方法呢？是你以前没有思考过的概念。这在弹球机底部区域的神经模式上得到了象征。如果你以前没想过这个想法，你甚至不知道这种模式是什么感觉，或者它在哪里。那么你怎么才能发展出这个新的想法呢？**不仅你不知道模式在哪里，也不知道它是什么样子，而且你决定往哪个方向前进时，都会被挡板阻挡**。要找到这个新的思维模式，你需要一种不同的思维方式。这就是`发散模式`的体现。看这些挡板之间有多宽的间隔。想法开始了，看看它如何在较大的范围内移动，四处弹跳。它可能会在撞击挡板之前走很长一段路。在这种发散模式的思维下，你可以**从一个完全不同的、更广阔的视角来看问题**。你可以**沿着新的路径建立新的神经连接**。虽然你无法像专注模式那样紧密地关注问题，来解决问题或理解概念的细微之处，但至少你能够到达你需要的初始位置，然后再聚焦到解决方案上。

Now as far as neuroscientists know right now, **you're either in the focused mode or the diffuse mode of thinking**. It seems you can't be in both thinking modes at the same time. It's kind of like a coin. We can see either one side, or the other side of the coin. But not both sides at the same time. Being in one mode seems to limit your access to the other mode's way of thinking. In our next video we're going to see how some extraordinary people access their diffuse ways of thinking to do great things. Thanks for learning about learning. I'm Barbara Oakley.

据神经科学家目前所知，你**要么处于专注模式，要么处于发散模式**。似乎你不能同时处于这两种思维模式中。这有点像一枚硬币。我们可以看到硬币的某一面，或者另一面，但不能同时看到两面。处于一种模式似乎会限制你访问另一种模式的思维方式。在下一个视频中，我们将看到一些非凡的人物如何利用他们的发散思维来做出伟大的事情。感谢你学习关于学习的内容。我是芭芭拉·奥克利。

### 1.2 Terrence Sejnowski & Barbara Oakley - Introduction to the Course Structure

*Dr. Sejnowski*: Welcome to Learning How to Learn. Your brain has amazing abilities, but it didn't come with an instruction manual. Perhaps the greatest gif that our brains give us is the ability to learn new things every day. On my way here, I thought about the journey that will take us to the last day of the course and how much we will learn along the way. Our goal is to give you a better understanding of how we learn, so that your brain becomes a better learner. These insights are based on solid research from neuroscience, from cognitive psychology, and also from dozens of leading instructors and practitioners in difficult-to-learn subjects. Whether you're a novice or an expert, you will find great new ways to improve your skills and techniques for learning, especially related to math and science.

Dr. Sejnowski：欢迎来到《学习如何学习》。你的大脑有着惊人的能力，但它没有附带操作手册。或许我们大脑给予我们最大的礼物就是每天学习新事物的能力。在来这里的路上，我思考了我们这段旅程将带我们走向课程的最后一天，以及我们在此过程中将学到多少东西。我们的目标是让你更好地理解如何学习，使你的大脑成为更好的学习者。这些见解基于神经科学、认知心理学的扎实研究，以及在难学科目中数十位顶尖教师和实践者的经验。无论你是新手还是专家，你都会发现一些极好的新方法来提高你的学习技能和技巧，尤其是与数学和科学相关的内容。

*Dr. Oakley*: This course is meant to help you reframe how you think about learning, to help reduce your frustration and increase your understanding. We approach things a little differently. You're not expected to have an in-depth background in any particular subject. Instead, you're expected to take these ideas and apply them to whatever subject you're trying to learn or improve in, to help you learn more deeply, effectively, and with less frustration. You'll hear experts from a variety of different disciplines talking about their best tips for learning more effectively. You can benefit from these ideas whether you are struggling in high school or soaring through math and science at graduate levels at a university.

Dr. Oakley：这门课程旨在帮助你**重新思考学习的方式，减少挫折感并提高理解能力**。我们的方式有些不同。你不需要具备某个特定学科的深入背景，而是要将这些想法**应用到你正在学习或想提高的任何学科中**，帮助你更深入、更有效地学习，并减少挫折感。你将听到来自不同领域的专家分享他们在更有效学习方面的最佳建议。无论你是在高中苦苦挣扎，还是在大学的数学和科学中游刃有余，你都可以从这些想法中受益。

*Dr. Sejnowski*: I'm a co-director of a science and learning center that is sponsored by the National Science Foundation, based here in La Jolla. In recent years, we've made great strides from research, in discovering how to learn most effectively. Finding a way to simply and effectively share these ideas with you, has been a big undertaking, but we feel it's well worth doing. You'll see that many of these ideas, although simple, are incredibly powerful. And along the way, we'll also learn a lot in the process of teaching you.

Dr. Sejnowski：我是一个由美国国家科学基金会赞助的科学与学习中心的联合主任，该中心位于拉霍亚。近年来，我们在研究如何最有效地学习方面取得了巨大进展。找到一个简单有效的方式来与你分享这些想法是一项重大任务，但我们认为这是值得做的。你会发现，虽然这些想法简单，但它们却极具力量。在这个过程中，我们也会在教学中学到很多东西。

*Dr. Oakley*: You'll see how you can fool yourself about whether you actually know the material. You'll discover new ways to *hold your focus* and embed the material more deeply and powerfully in your mind. And you'll learn to *condense key ideas you're learning about*, so you can grasp them more easily, master the simple, practical approaches outlined here, including simple tips to help prevent procrastination. And you'll be able to learn more effectively and with less frustration. This course is meant to enrich both your learning and your life. You'll able to get what you want from this material. So, welcome to the course, and happy learning!

Dr. Oakley：你会发现自己有时会欺骗自己，以为你真的掌握了某些内容。你将会学到一些新的方法来*保持专注*，并将这些材料更深、更有力地嵌入你的脑海中。你还将学会如何*浓缩你所学的关键想法*，这样你就可以更轻松地掌握它们，并精通我们在这里列出的简单实用的方法，包括一些防止拖延的小技巧。你将能够更有效地学习，并减少挫折感。这门课程旨在丰富你的学习和生活。你将能够从这些材料中得到你想要的东西。欢迎参加这门课程，祝你学习愉快！

### 1.3 Using the Focused & Diffuse Modes – or, a little Dali will do

So let's take a look at some famous people from history who used their different thinking modes to help them with their problem solving. If you look at that guy right there, he was Salvador Dali, a very well-known `surrealist painter` of the 20th century. He was the very definition of a wild and crazy guy. You can see him here with his pet ocelot, Babou. Dali used to have an interesting technique to help him come up with his fantastically creative surrealist paintings. He'd relax in a chair and let his mind go free, often still vaguely thinking about what he had been previously focusing on. He'd have a key in his hand, dangling it just above the floor. And as he would slip into his dreams, falling asleep, the key would fall from his hand and the clatter would wake him up, just in time so he could gather up those diffuse mode connections and ideas in his mind. And off he'd go back into the focused mode bringing with him the new connections he'd made while in the diffuse mode.

现在让我们来看一些历史上著名的人物，他们运用了不同的思维模式来帮助他们解决问题。如果你看那个家伙，他是萨尔瓦多·达利，20世纪非常著名的`超现实主义画家`。他堪称疯狂和古怪的代名词。你可以看到他和他的宠物山猫Babou在一起。达利用过一种有趣的技巧来激发他的超现实主义创作。他会放松地坐在椅子上，让思维自由驰骋，通常仍然隐约想着他之前专注的内容。他手里拿着一把钥匙，让它悬在地板上方。当他进入梦境、快要入睡时，钥匙会从手中掉落，发出的响声会把他惊醒，正好能抓住那些发散模式下产生的联想和想法。然后他会重新进入专注模式，带着那些在发散模式中获得的新联想继续工作。

Now you might think, well, you know, that's okay for an artist, but what is it have to do with more scientific or mathematical kinds of thinking? Well, if you look down here, this guy was Thomas Edison, one of the most brilliant inventors ever. According to legend, what Edison used to do was he'd sit and relax in his chair, holding ball bearings in his hand. He'd relax away letting his mind run free, although it would often noodle back in a much more relaxed way to what he'd been focusing on previously. When Edison would fall asleep, the ball bearings would drop and clatter to the ground just as with Dali, and it would wake Edison up and off he'd go with his ideas from the diffuse mode, ready to take them into the focused mode and build on them.

你可能会想，这对一位艺术家来说还行，但它和更科学或数学的思维有什么关系呢？看看下面的这个人，他是托马斯·爱迪生，有史以来最杰出的发明家之一。根据传说，爱迪生过去常常坐在椅子上放松，手里握着钢珠。他会放松心情，让思维自由驰骋，尽管有时它会以一种更放松的方式回到他之前专注的内容。当爱迪生睡着时，钢珠会掉下来，撞击地面发出响声，这和达利的方式相同，这也会把爱迪生惊醒，让他带着那些发散模式中的想法重新进入专注模式，继续深化它们。

So the bottom line is, **when you're learning something new, especially something that's a little more difficult, your mind needs to be able to go back and forth between the two different learning modes**. That's what helps you learn effectively. You might think of it as a bit analogous to building your strength by lifting weights. You would never plan to compete in a weight lifting competition by waiting until the very day before a meet and then spending that entire day working out like a fiend. I mean, it just doesn't happen that way. To gain muscular structure, you need to do a little work every day, gradually allowing your muscles to grow. Similarly, **to build neuro-structure, you need to do a little work every day, gradually allowing yourself to grow a neuro-scaffold to hang your thinking on, a little bit every day and that's the trick**.

所以，总结起来，**当你学习新东西时，尤其是一些稍微困难的内容，你的大脑需要在两种不同的学习模式之间来回切换。**这就是帮助你有效学习的关键。你可以把它类比为通过举重来增强力量。你永远不会等到比赛的前一天，才疯狂地锻炼一整天来准备一场举重比赛。事情不会这么发生。要获得肌肉结构，你需要每天做一点锻炼，逐渐让肌肉生长。同样地，**要构建神经结构，你需要每天做一点工作，逐渐让自己构建起一个神经框架，来支撑你的思维。每天一点点，这就是秘诀**。

In summary then:  We learned that analogies provide powerful techniques for learning.  We learned about how the brain's two different thinking modes, focused and diffuse, each helps us learn, but in very different ways.  And finally, we learned that learning something difficult can take time. Your brain needs to alternate its ways of learning as it grapples with and assimilates the new material. Thanks for learning about learning. I'm Barbara Oakley.

总之，我们学到了类比提供了强大的学习技巧；我们学到了大脑的两种不同思维模式——专注模式和发散模式——如何帮助我们以不同的方式学习；最后，我们学到了学习困难的内容可能需要时间。大脑需要在学习过程中交替使用不同的方式，才能消化和掌握新材料。感谢你学习关于学习的内容。我是芭芭拉·奥克利。

### 1.4 What is Learning?

Welcome to learning how to learn. My name is Terry Sejnowski. Let me introduce you to your brain! First, some brain surgery. We take off the skull and take out the brain. This brain weighs three pounds, but it consumes ten times more energy by weight than the rest of the body, a very expensive organ. It is the most complex device in the known universe. All of your thoughts, your hopes, your fears are in the neurons in this brain. We prize our abilities to do chess and math, but it takes years of practice to acquire these skills. And digital computers are much better at it than we are. It came as a surprise to discover that what we do so well and take for granted, like seeing, hearing, reaching, running, are all much more complex problems than we thought and way beyond the capability of the world's fastest digital computers. What this illustrates is that we are not consciously aware of how our brains work. Brains evolved to help us navigate complex environments, and most of the heavy lifting is done below our level of consciousness. And we don't need to know how it's done in order to survive.

欢迎来到《学习如何学习》。我是特里·塞诺夫斯基。让我为你介绍你的大脑！首先，我们做些脑外科手术。我们揭开颅骨，取出大脑。这个大脑重约三磅，但它消耗的能量是身体其他部分的十倍，是一个非常昂贵的器官。它是已知宇宙中最复杂的装置。你所有的思想、希望、恐惧都存储在大脑中的神经元里。我们珍视自己下棋和做数学题的能力，但这些技能需要多年的练习才能掌握。而数字计算机在这些方面比我们做得要好得多。令人惊讶的是，**我们做得很好并认为理所当然的事情，比如看、听、伸手、跑步，这些都比我们想象的要复杂得多**，甚至远超世界上最快的数字计算机的能力。这说明我们并不清楚大脑是如何工作的。**大脑进化的目的是帮助我们应对复杂的环境，而大部分的工作是在意识层面以下完成的。我们不需要知道它是如何运作的就可以生存**。

Psychologists who study **the unconscious** mind have found that **influences include thought processes, memory, emotions and motivation**. *We are only aware of a very small fraction of all of the activity in the brain*, so we need to rely on brain imaging techniques to guide us. Here is the activity map of someone's brain who was asked to lie still, at rest, in a brain imaging scanner. On the left is the side view of the brain and on the right is the view from the midline. The colors indicate brain areas whose activities were highly correlated, as shown by the time courses below, color-coded to the brain areas. The blue areas are highly active when the subject interacts with the world, but turn off in a resting state. The red-orange areas are most active in the resting state and are called the default mode network. Other brain areas are also more active when you are resting, and these areas can be further divided into groups of areas that have common patterns of activity. This is a new and intense area of research, and it will take time to sort out all the resting states and their functions.

研究无意识心灵的心理学家发现，**思维过程、记忆、情绪和动机都受到无意识的影响**。我们*只意识到大脑活动的一小部分*，因此我们需要依赖脑成像技术来引导我们。这是一个人在脑成像扫描仪中静卧休息时的大脑活动图。左边是大脑的侧视图，右边是从中线看到的视图。颜色显示了大脑中活动高度相关的区域，时间变化用颜色编码显示。蓝色区域在主体与外界互动时高度活跃，但在静息状态下关闭。红橙色区域在静息状态下最活跃，称为默认模式网络。其他脑区在你休息时也更活跃，这些区域可以进一步划分为具有共同活动模式的区域组。这是一个新兴且密集的研究领域，仍需要时间来厘清所有的静息状态及其功能。

There are a million billion synapses in your brain where memories are stored. The old view of the brain is that once it matures, the strengths of synapses can be adjusted by learning, but the pattern of connectivity does not change much unless there is brain damage. But now we know that **brain connectivity is dynamic and remains so even after it matures**. With new optical techniques for imaging single connections between neurons called synapses, we can see constant turnover, with new synapses being formed and others disappearing. This raises a puzzle. In the face of so much turnover, how do memories stay stable over so many years? This is a picture of one dendritic branch on a neuron which receives inputs from other neurons. The synapses are on the spiny knobs coming off the dendrite. On the top, the dendrite was imaged before learning. The same dendrite is shown below after learning and after sleep. Multiple synapses that are newly formed together on the same branch are indicated by the white arrowheads. You are looking down into the brain of a live animal. This is really a fantastic new technique. Synapses are less than a micron in diameter. In comparison, a human hair is around 20 microns in diameter. This new technique allows us to see how learning changes the structure of the brain with a resolution that is near the limit of light microscopy.

大脑中有一百万亿个突触，储存着记忆。旧的观点认为，一旦大脑成熟，突触的强度可以通过学习调整，但连接模式不会发生太大变化，除非大脑受到损伤。但现在我们知道，**大脑的连接是动态的，即使在成熟之后仍然如此**。通过新型的光学技术，我们可以观察神经元之间称为突触的单一连接，看到持续的变化，有新的突触形成，也有其他突触消失。这提出了一个难题。在如此多的变化面前，记忆是如何在多年内保持稳定的？这是神经元上的一个树突分支，它接收来自其他神经元的输入。突触位于树突上的小突起上。上面的是学习前成像的树突，下面的是学习后及睡眠后的同一树突。白色箭头标示了同一分支上新形成的多个突触。你正在观察的是一只活体动物的大脑。这是一项非常了不起的新技术。突触的直径不到一微米。相比之下，一根人类头发的直径约为20微米。这项新技术使我们能够看到学习如何以接近光学显微镜极限的分辨率改变大脑结构。

This illustrates that, intriguingly, that you are not the same person you were after a night's sleep or even a nap. It is if you went to bed with one brain and woke up with an upgrade. This is a better deal than you can get from Microsoft. Shakespeare, the great English poet, already knew this. Here is Macbeth lamenting his insomnia: “Sleep that knits up the raveled sleeve of care, the death of each day's life, sore labor's bath, balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course, chief nourisher in life's feast.” Here, Shakespeare is making an analogy between knitted clothes and sleep that knits up the loose threads of experience and concerns during the day and weaves them into the tapestry of your life story. You will learn in this first week how to take advantage of your unconscious mind, and also sleep, to make it easier to learn new things and solve problems. During the lectures you may ask yourself, how does the brain do this? A good place to find out more about your brain is the website brainfacts.org, brainfacts, one word, .org (http://www.brainfacts.org/). You will find a wealth of interesting things about brains and behavior, and in particular about learning and memory. I am Terry Sejnowski. Happy learning until we meet again.

这说明，耐人寻味的是，你在一夜的睡眠甚至小憩之后已不再是之前的那个人。就好像你带着一个大脑去睡觉，醒来时却得到了升级版。这比微软给你的交易还要好。莎士比亚，这位伟大的英国诗人，早已知道这一点。这里是麦克白在哀叹他的失眠：“睡眠能缝合烦恼的散线，是每天生命的死亡，是辛劳的沐浴，是创伤心灵的膏药，是大自然的第二道主菜，是生命盛宴的主要养料。”在这里，莎士比亚将编织的衣服与睡眠做了类比，睡眠将白天散乱的经历和忧虑缝合起来，编织成你人生故事的锦缎。在第一周的课程中，你将学习如何利用你的潜意识，以及睡眠，来更轻松地学习新事物和解决问题。在讲座中，你可能会问自己，大脑是如何做到这一点的？一个了解更多大脑知识的好去处是网站brainfacts.org，一个词，[brainfacts.org](http://www.brainfacts.org/)。在那里，你会发现大量关于大脑和行为的有趣内容，特别是关于学习和记忆的内容。我是特里·塞诺夫斯基。愿你学习愉快，直到我们再次见面。

### 1.5 A Procrastination Preview

Everybody has some issues with procrastination. Because if you're working on something, it means you're not working, on a lot of other things. But some people have more issues with procrastination than others. In this video, we're going to give you a little insight into procrastination. Why it arises, and a powerful little tool to help you address it. When you look at something that you really rather not do, it seems that you activate the areas of your brain associated with pain. Your brain, naturally enough, looks for a way to stop that negative stimulation by switching your attention to something else. But here's the trick. **Researchers discovered that not long after people might start actually working out what they didn't like, that neuro-discomfort disappeared**. So it seems what happens when you procrastinate, is something like this; first, you observe, and get a cue about something that causes a tiny bit of unease. You don't like it, so to make the sensation go away you turn your attention from whatever caused that unease. You turn toward something more pleasant. The result, you feel happier, temporarily. We're going to talk more about procrastination later on. But in the mean, time I'm going to let you in on a handy little mental tool. This tool is called, the Pomodoro. It was invented by Francesco Cirillo, in the early 1980's. Pomodoro is Italian for tomato. The timer you use often looks like a tomato and really, a timer is all there is to this elegant little technique. All you need to do, is *set a timer to 25 minutes, turn off all interruptions, and then focus*. That's it! Most anybody can focus for 25 minutes. The only last important thing is to *give yourself a little reward when you're done*. A few minutes of web surfing, a cup of coffee, or a bite of chocolate, even just stretching or chatting mindlessly, allowing your brain to enjoyably change its focus for a while. You'll find that using the Pomodoro technique is very effective. It's a little like doing an intense 25 minute workout at a mental gym. Followed by some mental relaxation. Give it a try. Next, we're going to see how one very shy ten year old, changed her brain.

每个人都有拖延的问题。因为当你专注于某件事情时，意味着你没有做很多其他的事情。但有些人比其他人更容易拖延。在这个视频中，我们会为你提供一些关于拖延症的见解。为什么它会产生，以及一个强大的小工具来帮助你应对它。**当你看着某件你不想做的事情时，似乎会激活你大脑中与痛苦相关的区域。大脑自然而然地会寻找一种方法来停止这种负面刺激，方法就是把注意力转移到其他事情上**。但这里有一个诀窍。研究人员发现，不久之后，当人们开始**真正处理他们不喜欢的事情时**，那种**神经不适就会消失**。所以，*拖延症的发生大概是这样：首先，你观察到并得到某个提示，提示某件让你有点不安的事情。你不喜欢它，所以为了让这种感觉消失，你转移注意力，转向某些更愉快的事情。结果是你暂时感到更开心*。我们稍后会更多地讨论拖延症。但在此期间，我要告诉你一个方便的小工具。这个工具叫做“番茄钟”，它是由弗朗切斯科·西里洛在1980年代早期发明的。番茄钟是意大利语中“番茄”的意思。你使用的定时器通常看起来像一个番茄，实际上，这个简单的小技巧所需要的只是一个定时器。你需要做的就是*将定时器设定为25分钟，关掉所有的干扰，然后专注于任务*。就是这样！几乎任何人都能专注25分钟。最后一个重要的步骤是，当你*完成后给自己一点奖励*。几分钟的上网冲浪、一杯咖啡、一块巧克力，甚至只是伸展一下或闲聊几句，允许你的大脑愉快地转移一下注意力。你会发现使用番茄工作法非常有效。这有点像在精神健身房里进行25分钟的高强度锻炼，之后进行一些精神放松。试试看吧。接下来，我们将看到一个非常害羞的十岁女孩是如何改变她的大脑的。

### 1.6 Practice Makes Permanent

Yep, that's me when I was 10. I loved animals, handicrafts, and dreaming. Back then, I was the belligerent queen of anti-math. I neglected, ignored, flunked, and downright hated math and science all through grade school, middle school, and high school. It's strange to realize I'm now a professor of Engineering. I enlisted in the army right out of high school to study language at the Defense Language Institute. That's me at 18, looking very nervous and very focused while throwing a hand grenade. I only started to study math and science when I was 26 years old, after I got out of the military. At first, it was really hard. There were all these quick thinkers in my classes who seemed to get everything a lot easier and faster than me. Sometimes I'd take a break for a few months, I'd go out and work as a Russian translator on Soviet trawlers. That's me up in the Bering Sea. And I'd come back to school and try and learn some more. As I gained technical know-how, new doors started opening up for me. I ended up working as a radio operator at the South Pole Station in Antarctica. That's where I met my husband. I always say I had to go the end of the Earth to meet that man. Here he is, after only 10 minutes outside at minus 70 degrees Fahrenheit with a 60-mile-an-hour wind. The wind chill takes it off the charts.

是的，那是我十岁的时候。我喜欢动物、手工艺和做梦。那时，我是反数学的“好斗女王”，在小学、初中和高中期间，我忽视、逃避、考试不及格，甚至完全厌恶数学和科学。如今，我意识到我已经成为了一名工程学教授，这真是有点奇怪。高中毕业后，我直接参军，在国防语言学院学习语言。那是我18岁的时候，紧张又专注地扔手榴弹。我直到26岁从军队退役后，才开始学习数学和科学。一开始真的很难，班里有些思维敏捷的同学，似乎比我更快更容易理解一切。有时我会休息几个月，出去当苏联拖网渔船上的俄语翻译。那是我在白令海上的样子。之后我会回到学校，继续努力学习。随着我掌握了技术知识，新的大门开始为我打开。我最终在南极洲的南极站担任无线电操作员。就是在那里，我遇到了我的丈夫。我总是说我必须走到地球的尽头才能遇到那个男人。这是他在外面待了10分钟后，气温零下70华氏度，风速每小时60英里。风寒指数已经超出了图表范围。

Now, I wasn't natural in math and science. Not at all. The way I succeeded was to gradually begin to figure out some tricks. But let's back up a step. In the greater scheme of all the different careers and disciplines that people can pursue, why are those involving math and science, sometimes, a bit more challenging? We think it may be related, at least in part, to the `abstract nature of the ideas`. I mean, let's take a cow for example, out standing in a field. If you have the word cow, you can point right to a cow to learn what that word means. Even the letters for the word cow, C-O-W, are roughly analogous to sounds that they stand for. But for mathematical ideas, there's often no analogous thing that you can point to. There are no plus signs standing out in a field. No multiplication, division, or other kinds of things that can directly equate to mini mathematical or scientific terms. These terms are more abstract, in other words. Well, you might say, yeah, but what about ones like love, zest, or hope? Those are all abstract. Yes they are, but the thing is, these abstract terms are often related to our emotions. We can feel our emotions, even if we can't see and point to concrete examples, like we could with the cow. This means it's important to practice with ideas and concepts your learning in math and science, just like anything else you’re learning to help enhance and strengthen the neural connection you’re making during the learning process.

我并不是数学和科学的天才，完全不是。我成功的方式是逐渐摸索出一些小技巧。但让我们退一步思考。在所有不同的职业和学科中，为什么涉及数学和科学的领域有时会更加具有挑战性？我们认为这至少部分与这些想法的`抽象性`有关。比如说，拿一头站在田野里的牛来说，如果你有“牛”这个词，你可以直接指向一头牛来学习这个词的含义。甚至“牛”这个词的字母C-O-W也大致对应了它们代表的声音。但对于数学概念来说，通常没有类似的东西可以指向。田野里没有加号，也没有乘法、除法等可以直接等同于数学或科学术语的东西。这些术语更加抽象。你可能会说，是的，但像“爱”、“热情”或“希望”这样的词也是抽象的。没错，但这些抽象的词往往与我们的情感相关。即使我们看不到它们的具体例子，我们也能感受到自己的情绪。这意味着你需要像学习其他任何东西一样，练习数学和科学中的概念，以增强你在学习过程中建立的神经连接。

You can see on your left here the symbolic representation of a thought pattern. Neurons become linked together through repeated use. **The more abstract something is, the more important it is to practice in order to bring those ideas into reality for you. Even if the ideas you're dealing with are abstract, the neural thought patterns you are creating are real and concrete.** At least they are if you build and strengthen them through practice. Here's a way to picture what's going on. When you f*irst begin to understand something*, for example, how to solve a problem, *the neural pattern from is there, but very weak*. Kind of like the faint pattern at the top of our paintball machine analogy here. When you *solve the problem again fresh from the start*, without looking at the solution, you, *you begin deepening that neuron pattern*, kind of like the darker pattern you see here in the middle. And *when you have the problem down cold*, so you can go over each step completely and concisely in your mind without even looking at the solution, and you've even had practice on related problems, why then, the pattern is like this dark firm pattern you can see towards the bottom of the pinball frame. *Practice makes permanent.*

你可以在左侧看到一个思维模式的符号表示。通过反复使用，神经元之间的连接变得紧密。**某些事物越抽象，练习就越重要，这样你才能将这些想法带入现实。即使你处理的是抽象的概念，但你所创造的神经思维模式是实实在在的、具体的**。至少如果你通过练习去构建和强化它们，它们就是这样的。这里有一个形象化的例子。当你*开始理解*某些东西时，比如如何解决一个问题，*神经模式已经存在，但非常微弱*，就像我们弹球机类比中顶部的淡淡图案。当你*再次从头开始解决问题时*，不看解决方案，你就开始*加深那个神经模式*，就像中间的深色图案。而当你*完全掌握问题*，能够在脑海中完整清晰地回顾每一步，甚至在类似问题上也进行了练习时，那么这个模式就像在弹球机框架底部的深色牢固图案。*实践造就永久。*

When you're learning, what you want to do is study something. Study it hard by focusing intently. Then take a break or at least change your focus to something different for a while. During this time of seeming relaxation, **your brain's diffuse mode has a chance to work away in the background and help you out with your conceptual understanding**. Your, your neural mortar in some sense has a chance to dry. **If you don't do this, if instead you learn by cramming, your knowledge base will look more like this, all in a jumble with everything confused, a poor foundation.** If you have problems with procrastination, that's when you want to use the Pomodoro, that brief timer. This helps you get going, using brief periods each day of focused attention that will help you start building the neural patterns you need to be more successful in learning more challenging materials.

当你学习时，你需要做的是认真学习，集中精力，然后休息一下，或者至少转移注意力，做一会儿其他的事情。在这段看似放松的时间里，你大脑的**发散模式有机会在背景中工作，帮助你理解概念**。某种程度上，你的大脑“神经灰浆”有机会凝固。**如果你不这样做，而是通过突击学习，那么你的知识基础就会像这样，混乱不堪，缺乏良好的基础**。如果你有拖延症问题，这时候就可以使用番茄工作法，这种简短的定时器可以帮助你开始。通过每天一段集中的注意力，帮助你建立学习更具挑战性材料所需的神经模式。

Next stop, we'll be talking about chunking, the vital essence of how you grasp and master key ideas. I'm Barbara Oakley.

接下来，我们将讨论“组块化”，这是你掌握关键思想的核心精髓。我是芭芭拉·奥克利。

### 1.7 Introduction to Memory

When I look back on my childhood or I remember some words from Spanish or from Russian, Здравствуйте, or I bring to mind one of Maxwell's equations, I'm drawing on portions of my brain involved in `long term memory`. But what I'm trying to hold a few ideas in mind to connect them together so I can understand a concept or solve a problem, I'm using my `working memory`. Obviously, sometimes I'll bring something from my long term memory into my working memory, so I can think about it. So the two types of memory are related. There are lots of different ways to slice our understanding a memory, but for this course on learning, we're going to talk about only these two major memory systems, `working memory` and `long term memory`. **Working memory is the part of memory that has to do with what you're immediately and consciously processing in your mind.** Your working memory is centered out of the prefrontal cortex, although as we'll see later, there are also connections to other parts of your brain, so you can access long term memories.

当我回顾我的童年，或者我记起一些西班牙语或俄语的单词，比如“Здравствуйте”，或者我想起麦克斯韦方程中的一个，我是在调用大脑中涉及`长期记忆`的部分。但当我试图将一些想法连接起来，以便理解某个概念或解决问题时，我使用的是`工作记忆`。显然，有时我会从长期记忆中提取一些东西放入工作记忆中，这样我可以思考它们。因此，这两种记忆类型是相关的。理解记忆有很多不同的方式，但在这门关于学习的课程中，我们只讨论这两大主要的记忆系统：`工作记忆`和`长期记忆`。**工作记忆是你当下正在处理并有意识思考的部分。**工作记忆主要集中在前额叶皮层，尽管正如我们稍后将看到的，它还与大脑的其他部分相连，因此你可以访问长期记忆。

Researchers used to think that our working memory could hold around seven items or chunks, but now it's widely believed that the working memory is **holds only about four chunks of information.** We tend to automatically group memory items in to chunks so it seems our working memory is bigger than it actually is. Although your working memory is like a blackboard, it's not a very good blackboard. **You often need to keep repeating what you are trying to work with so it's stays in your working memory.** For example, you'll sometimes repeat a phone number to yourself until you have a chance to write it down. Repetition is needed so that your metabolic vampires, that is, natural dissipating processes, don't suck those memories away. You may find yourself shutting yours eyes to keep any other items from intruding into the limited slots of your working memory as you concentrate. So we know that short term memory is something like an inefficient mental blackboard.

研究人员曾经认为我们的工作记忆可以容纳大约七个项目或组块，但现在人们普遍认为工作记忆**只能容纳大约四个信息组块**。我们倾向于自动将记忆项目分组，这让我们觉得工作记忆比实际大一些。虽然你的工作记忆像是一个黑板，但它并不是一个很好的黑板。**你经常需要重复你正在处理的内容，这样它才能留在你的工作记忆中**。例如，你有时会反复念一个电话号码，直到有机会把它写下来。需要重复是因为你的“代谢吸血鬼”（也就是自然消耗的过程）会把那些记忆吸走。你可能会闭上眼睛，避免其他信息干扰你有限的工作记忆容量，从而更好地集中注意力。因此我们知道，短期记忆就像是一个效率低下的心智黑板。

The other form of memory, `long term memory`, **is like a storage warehouse**. And just like a warehouse, it's distributed over a big area. Different kinds of long term memories are stored in different regions of the brain. Research has shown when you first try to put a short term memory in long term memory, you need to revisit it at least a few times to increase the chances that you'll be able to find later when you might need it. **The long term memory storage warehouse is immense. It's got room for billions of items.** In fact, there can be so many items they can bury each other, so **it can be difficult for you to find the information you need unless you practice and repeat at least a few times**.


另一种记忆形式，`长期记忆`，**就像一个储存仓库**。就像仓库一样，它分布在一个很大的区域。不同类型的长期记忆存储在大脑的不同区域。研究表明，当你第一次尝试将短期记忆转入长期记忆时，你需要多次回顾它，以增加你在以后需要时找到它的机会。**长期记忆储存仓库是巨大的，它可以容纳数十亿条信息**。事实上，储存的内容太多了，它们有时会互相掩盖，所以**如果你不进行足够的练习和重复，就很难找到你需要的信息**。

Long term memory is important because it's *where you store fundamental concepts and techniques that are often involved in whatever you're learning about*. When you encounter something new, you often use your working memory to handle it. If you want to move that information into your long term memory, it often takes time and practice. To help with this process, use a technique called spaced repetition. This technique involves repeating what you're trying to retain, but what you want to do is space this repetition out. Repeating a new vocabulary word or a problem solving technique, for example, over a number of days. Extending your practice over several days does make a difference. Research has shown that if you try to glue things into your memory by repeating something 20 times in one evening, for example, it won't stick nearly as well as if you practice it the **same number of times over several days**. This is like building the brick wall we saw earlier. If you don't leave time for the mortar to dry, that is, time for the synoptic connections to form and strengthen, you won't have a very good structure.

长期记忆很重要，因为它*是你存储基础概念和技术的地方，这些概念和技术通常与你正在学习的内容密切相关*。当你遇到新事物时，通常会使用工作记忆来处理它。如果你想将这些信息转移到长期记忆中，通常需要时间和练习。为了帮助这个过程，可以使用一种称为“间隔重复”的技术。这种技术涉及重复你想要记住的内容，但要把这些重复间隔开来。例如，重复一个新词汇或一个解决问题的技巧，可以分几天来进行。研究表明，如果你在一晚上重复某件事情20次，它的记忆效果远不如你**在几天内分次练习**一样好。这就像我们之前提到的建造砖墙一样。如果你不留出时间让“灰浆”干透，即让突触连接形成和加强，你的结构就不会很牢固。

And talk about lasting structure, look at this part of the Acropolis here. Thanks for learning about learning. I'm Barbara Oakley.

### 1.8 The Importance of Sleep in Learning

You might be surprised to learn that *just plain being awake creates toxic products in your brain*. How does the brain get rid of these poisons? Turns out that when you sleep, your brain cells shrink. This causes an increase in the space between your brain cells. It's like unblocking a stream. Fluid can flow past these cells and wash the toxins out. So sleep, which can sometimes seem like such a waste of time, is actually your brain's way of keeping itself clean and healthy.

你可能会惊讶地发现，*仅仅是清醒着就会在大脑中产生有毒物质*。那么大脑是如何清除这些毒素的呢？事实证明，当你睡觉时，大脑细胞会收缩，这就增加了细胞之间的空间。就像疏通了一条溪流，液体可以流过这些细胞，将毒素冲洗掉。因此，睡眠，有时看似是在浪费时间，实际上是大脑保持清洁和健康的一种方式。

So, let's get right to a critical idea. Taking a test without getting enough sleep means you're operating with a brain that's got little metabolic toxins floating around in it. Poisons that make it so you can't think very clearly. It's kind of like trying to drive a car that's got sugar in its gas tank. Doesn't work too well. In fact, getting too little sleep doesn't just make you do worse on tests, too little sleep, over too long of a time, can also be associated with all sorts of nasty Conditions, including headaches, depression, heart disease, diabetes, and just plain dying earlier. But sleep does more than just allow your brain to wash away toxins. **It's actually important part of the memory and learning process**. It's seems that **during sleep your brain tidies up ideas and concepts your thinking about and learning. It erases the less important parts of memories and simultaneously strengthens areas that you need or want to remember. During sleep your brain also rehearses some of the tougher parts of whatever you're trying to learn, going over and over neural patterns to deepen and strengthen them.**

现在让我们直接讨论一个关键概念。没有充足睡眠的情况下参加考试，意味着你在用一个充满代谢毒素的大脑在运作。这些毒素会使你无法清晰思考。这就像试图驾驶一辆油箱里掺了糖的汽车一样，不会有很好的效果。事实上，缺乏睡眠不仅会让你在考试中表现更差，长期的睡眠不足还与各种不良状况有关，包括头痛、抑郁、心脏病、糖尿病，甚至更早去世。但睡眠不仅仅是让大脑清除毒素，它实际上是**记忆和学习过程中的一个重要部分**。**睡眠期间，大脑会整理你所思考和学习的概念和想法，删除那些不太重要的部分，同时强化你需要或想要记住的部分。睡眠期间，大脑还会练习你试图学习的一些较难的部分，不断重复神经模式，以加深和强化它们。**

**Sleep has also been shown to make a remarkable difference in your ability to figure out difficult problems and to understand what you're trying to learn.** It's as if the complete deactivation of the conscious you in the pre-frontal cortex at the forefront of your brain helps other areas of your brain start talking more easily to one another, allowing them to put together the neural solution to your learning task while you're sleeping. Of course, you must also plant the seed for your diffuse mode by first doing focused mode work. If you're going over what you're learning right before you take a nap or going to sleep for the evening you have an increased chance of dreaming about it. If you go even further and set it in mind that you want to dream about the material, it seems to improve your chances of dreaming about it still further. Dreaming about what you're studying can substantially enhance your ability to understand. It somehow consolidates your memories into easier to grasp chunks. And now time for a little sleep.

研究还表明，**睡眠对解决困难问题和理解你正在学习的内容有显著的帮助。**似乎当大脑前额叶皮层的有意识部分完全停用时，大脑的其他区域更容易彼此沟通，从而在你睡觉时为你的学习任务找出神经解决方案。当然，你还需要先通过专注模式的工作来播下发散模式的种子。如果你在小睡或晚上睡觉前复习你正在学习的内容，你更有可能在梦中出现这些内容。如果你进一步有意识地设想要梦到这些材料，似乎更能提高你梦到它们的几率。梦到你在学习的内容可以大大增强你对它的理解能力，它在某种程度上将你的记忆巩固为更易掌握的块状信息。现在，是时候小睡一会儿了。

### 1.10 Summary Week 1

Although living brains are pretty complex, this week we've used `metaphor` and `analogy` and zombies to help simplify matters. In essence, people have two fundamentally different modes of thinking that, for the purpose of this course, we've labeled `focused` and `diffuse`. We used a simple pinball analogy to help us understand the differences between the modes. The focused mode has tight spacing for the rubber bumpers which seems to, in some sense, help keep your thoughts concentrated. The diffuse mode, on the other hand, has more widely spaced bumpers that allow for more broad ranging ways of thinking. The focused mode is centered more in the prefrontal cortex, and it often seems to involve thinking about things you're somewhat familiar with. For example, if you're familiar with multiplication and you're trying to solve a multiplication problem or you're trying to find a word that rhymes with another word. **You're probably stepping along the somewhat familiar pathways of the focused mode. But if you're trying to solve or figure out something new, it often cries out for the more broad-ranging perspectives of the diffuse mode.** This mode, as it turns out, is representative of the brain's many neural resting states.

尽管活人的大脑相当复杂，本周我们使用了`比喻`、`类比`和僵尸来帮助简化问题。本质上，人有两种根本不同的思维模式，为了这门课程的目的，我们将它们称为“`专注模式`”和“`发散模式`”。我们用一个简单的弹球类比来帮助理解这两种模式的区别。专注模式中的橡胶挡板间距较小，这在某种程度上有助于保持你的思维集中。另一方面，发散模式的挡板间距更大，允许更广泛的思维方式。专注模式主要集中在前额叶皮层，并且通常涉及你相对熟悉的事物。例如，**当你熟悉乘法并试图解决一个乘法问题，或者试图找到一个押韵的词时，你可能正在沿着专注模式中相对熟悉的路径前进**。但**如果你试图解决或理解一些新的东西，往往需要更广泛视角的发散模式。**这种模式代表了大脑的多种神经静息状态。

**Creative thinkers throughout history, whatever their discipline, have found ways to access the diffuse mode, often more directly and quickly.** But we all access this mode quite naturally when we do things like go for a walk or take a shower or even just drift off to sleep. When we find ourselves stuck on a problem, or even if we're unsure of a situation in the course of living our daily life, it's often a good idea, once you've focused directly on the situation, to let things settle back, and take a bit more time. That way, more neural processing can take place, often below conscious awareness in the diffuse mode. The thing is, it often takes time for neural processing to take place, and time as well to build the new neural structures that allow us to learn something new. This is why **tackling procrastination is so very important.** The easiest way to tackle procrastination is to use the Pomodoro technique; that brief 25 minute stretch of focused concentration, followed by a bit of mental relaxation. **It's through practice and repetition that we can help enhance and strengthen the neural structures we're building as we're learning something new. Practice and repetition is particularly important for more abstract topics.**

历史上各个学科的**创造性思考者都找到了一些方法来快速且直接地进入发散模式**。但我们在日常生活中也会自然地进入这种模式，比如散步、洗澡，甚至只是准备入睡时。当我们在一个问题上卡住，或者在日常生活中遇到不确定的情况时，一旦你集中精力思考过这个情况，退一步并花一点时间让事情冷静下来通常是个好主意。这样一来，更多的神经处理可以在发散模式下发生，通常是在意识觉察不到的情况下进行。问题是，**神经处理需要时间，同样也需要时间来构建新的神经结构，使我们能够学习新事物**。这就是为什么**解决拖延症如此重要**。最简单的方法是使用番茄工作法：25分钟的集中注意力，然后进行短暂的精神放松。通过练习和重复，我们可以帮助增强和强化在学习新事物过程中建立的神经结构。对于更抽象的主题，练习和重复尤为重要。

Memory, of course, is an important aspect of learning. **There are four slots in our working memory. Things can fall out of those slots unless we keep repeating them to hold them in mind.** In that sense, working memory is like a not very good blackboard. Long term memory, on the other hand, is like a storage warehouse. If you practiced and repeated something well enough to get it into long term memory, you can usually call it up later if you need it, although you may need an occasional bit of repetition to freshen the memory up. It's never a good idea to cram your learning by repeating things many times all in one day. Because that's like trying to build muscle by lifting weights all in one day. There's no time for solid structures to grow.

记忆当然是学习的一个重要方面。**我们的工作记忆有四个“槽位”，如果我们不反复重复，信息可能会从这些槽位中滑落**。从这个角度来看，工作记忆就像一个不太好的黑板。而长期记忆则像一个储存仓库。如果你通过足够的练习和重复把某些东西存入长期记忆，那么在需要的时候通常可以把它取出来，尽管你可能需要偶尔的重复来重新巩固记忆。一次性在一天内重复许多次来突击学习是不可取的，因为这就像试图在一天内通过举重来增长肌肉一样，没有时间让坚固的结构成长。

We've also learned of **the importance of sleep in washing away the toxins that develop during our day's activities.** You want to avoid taking tests or doing anything difficult with little sleep the night before, because it's like trying to think with poison on the brain. And just as importantly, **exercise is surprisingly valuable in helping improve both our memory and our ability to learn.**

我们还了解到睡眠的重要性，**睡眠能够清除我们白天活动中产生的毒素**。如果在前一天晚上没有得到足够的睡眠就去考试或处理任何困难的事情，就像是在用有毒的大脑进行思考。同样重要的是，**运动在帮助改善记忆和学习能力方面有着出人意料的价值**。

We've had a lot of fun while learning this week, I'll bet you'll find next week's material to be even more exciting. I'm Barbara Oakley. Thanks for learning how to learn.

本周我们在学习中玩得很开心，我相信下周的内容会更加精彩。我是芭芭拉·奥克利，感谢你学习如何学习。

### 1.11 Excitement About What’s Next! Mary Anne Nestor Gives Special Hints

Hi, I'm Mary Anne, one of the TA's for the Learning How to Learn Course. The first module is almost over and I would like to take a minute to encourage you. I can tell you from my own experience this course has changed how I study and learn. Before this course I would study hard, but no matter how much I studied I couldn't retain what I learned. Honestly, I thought there was something wrong with me. Then I took this course and I found out it was the way I was learning, or thought I was learning, that was the problem. All these years of schooling, including an undergraduate degree, and a master’s degree and I never had one instructor show me what the instructors in this course share with us. Using the techniques I learned in this course, I now know how to retain the information I want to learn. Participants in other courses sometimes drop the first week. But don't do that in this course. You will lose out on an opportunity of a lifetime. Knowing how we can learn effectively is a life skill everyone needs, no matter where we are in life. It's never too late. If you see me in the discussion forum, say hello. I'd love to hear your thoughts and how we can help each other learn, how to learn.

嗨，我是Mary Anne，是《学习如何学习》课程的助教之一。第一模块快结束了，我想花一点时间鼓励你们。根据我的亲身经历，我可以告诉你们，这门课程改变了我的学习方式。在上这门课之前，我非常努力地学习，但不管我学了多少，我都无法记住所学的内容。坦白说，我以为是我自己有问题。后来，我参加了这门课程，发现问题其实出在我的学习方式上，或者说是我认为的学习方式。多年来的求学经历，包括本科和硕士学位期间，都没有一个老师像这门课程的老师们一样，向我们分享这些学习技巧。通过这门课程学到的技巧，我现在知道如何记住我想学习的信息了。其他课程的学员有时会在第一周就退出，但请不要在这门课程中这样做。你将失去一次难得的机会。学习如何高效学习是每个人都需要的生活技能，无论我们处于人生的哪个阶段，学习永远不嫌晚。如果你在讨论区看到我，记得打声招呼。我很想听听你的想法，以及我们如何互相帮助学习如何学习。

### 1.15 A Posting about Anxiety, Depression and PTSD from a learner in Learning How to learn

I know these are topics that many might not want to talk about.  My family and friends certainly do not want to talk about these topics with me.

我知道这些话题可能让许多人感到不适。我的家人和朋友也不愿意和我讨论这些内容。

I am dealing with trauma and suffer from severe depression, anxiety and PTSD.  Until recently I was working full time (currently I am on sick leave) and by many I was considered to be completely healthy and high functioning and in a sense, from certain perspectives, I was.  In social contexts,  peer and manager reviews at work and family gatherings I did everything that everyone expected of me and what I understood as being ‘successful’ in the eyes of the corporate and academic world.  I excelled in university, a top performer at my job and also my friends would ALL describe me as fun and outgoing and smart and a hard worker. But I have suffered from these major afflictions for much of my adult life and have just never really been able to make strong headway despite all the investigation, doctors, medication, self awareness programs, years of meditation, research studies and experiments I have tried on myself and undertaken.

我正在处理创伤，同时患有严重的抑郁、焦虑和PTSD。直到最近，我还在全职工作（目前正在病假中）。许多人认为我是完全健康且高功能的，从某些角度来说，这确实是事实。在社交场合、同事和经理的评价中，以及家庭聚会中，我做了所有人期待我做的事情，也达到了企业和学术界所谓“成功”的标准。我在大学中表现优异，是工作中的顶尖员工，朋友们都认为我是一个有趣、外向、聪明且努力工作的人。然而，多年来，我一直饱受这些重大困扰的折磨，无论我尝试了多少调查、医生、药物、提高自我意识的计划、多年的冥想、研究和自我实验，都无法取得实质性进展。

Now, through Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski's course, I have learned that procrastination is strongly tied to my afflictions.  Procrastination for me is linked to ‘experiential avoidance’ and a strong internal critic that is at many times not quite capable of being flexible or kind when faced with product outcomes.  To say I am a perfectionist is an understatement, and perfectionism is a label that unfortunately does not do its human companions justice.  The word ‘perfectionist’ in my opinion is too easily applauded by some and too often considered ‘cute and neurotic’ by others.  In my case perfectionism is a label that covers up a deep underlying need for safety, understanding and avoidance of shame and uncomfortable experiences.

现在，通过Barbara Oakley和Terrence Sejnowski的课程，我了解到拖延与我的这些困扰息息相关。对我来说，拖延与“体验性回避”和严厉的内在批评者密切相关，而这个内在批评者在面对成果时常常缺乏灵活性和宽容。说我是个完美主义者并不足以概括，而“完美主义”这个标签往往无法公正地描述其对人的影响。在我看来，“完美主义”这个词有时过于轻易地被人赞美，也常常被视为“可爱又神经质”。对我来说，完美主义是一个掩盖深层需求的标签，这些需求包括安全感、理解，以及对羞耻感和不适经历的回避。

Through this course I have found the information on habits, focus on process vs product, using willpower ONLY to overcome the first bit of response to the cue, Pomodoro technique, rewards, diffuse mode, and importance of sleep, to name just a few concepts explored in Learning How to Learn, so immensely useful and applicable to my symptoms.  Each of these concepts keep me grounded to a theory that avoids mental health labels and instead values accessible work process steps.

通过这门课程，我学到了许多关于习惯、过程与成果的关注、仅利用意志力来应对触发的初始反应、番茄工作法、奖励、扩散模式，以及睡眠重要性等内容。这些概念对我的症状极具实用性和适用性。这些理念让我摆脱了心理健康标签，转而专注于可操作的工作流程。

I have cancelled several commitments since this course has started so that I could stay home and take notes on video lectures and do my Pomodoros (on my to do list I write down the number of Pomodoros I am going to apply on each topic instead of a length of minutes or hours, I just like writing '2 pomodoros' ;)  And I feel fantastic!  Really, there is nothing that has helped my mood, sleep, eating, anxiety, feelings of guilt/shame etc than making small 'process oriented' to do lists for myself and accomplishing them without focus on the actual product.  After doing two Pomodoros with a break in-between I feel like I can just keep going, bring it on, bring on more (okay, well it took a few days to get to that level of excitement, but I got there).

自从开始这门课程以来，我取消了几项承诺，留在家中做笔记并实践番茄工作法（在我的待办事项列表中，我会写下计划在每个主题上使用的番茄时间数量，而不是具体的分钟或小时数，我喜欢写“2个番茄”）。这种方法让我感觉非常棒！实际上，没有什么比为自己制定“过程导向型”的待办事项清单并完成它们更能改善我的情绪、睡眠、饮食、焦虑以及内疚/羞耻感了。在完成两个番茄并休息后，我觉得自己可以继续下去，就像“来吧，再多点也没关系！”（好吧，这种兴奋感花了几天时间才达到，但我确实做到了）。

Depression/anxiety/trauma/PTSD (I am not comparing them or putting them in one group, its just easier to write them like that) greatly affect one’s ability to concentrate, read, focus and keep things in memory.  The fact I am retaining and understanding and making links through my work in this course is simply blowing me away.  It is a testament to the evidence and facts presented via this course and the techniques that are advocated.

抑郁、焦虑、创伤和PTSD（我并不是在比较它们或将它们归为一类，只是写起来更方便）严重影响了一个人集中注意力、阅读、专注和记忆的能力。我现在能够通过这门课程理解并建立起各种联系，这令我震惊。这是对课程所呈现的证据和技巧的有力证明。


One of the key reasons this course and the information presented has had such an impact on me and touched me so deeply where other books/group therapy etc could not is that Dr. Oakley has a very gentle, smiling, kind demeanor to her that I felt extremely safe with.  Meaning I literally found it a pleasure to listen to her voice and watch her and see her presence in the videos.  I felt like I was working with a kind teacher and, for me, it took me back to grade school days where I felt like I could do anything and the teachers really believed in me and I was not afraid of them.  Dr. Oakley’s voice tone, facial expressions and body gestures all helped contribute to a sense of safety and authenticity I valued and believed as I listened to and watched her video lectures.

这门课程及其内容对我的深远影响，部分原因在于Dr. Oakley温和、友善且带有微笑的教学风格让我感到极为安全。听她的声音，看她的视频，我感到如同在与一位亲切的老师合作。这让我回想起小学时代，那个时候我觉得自己可以做任何事情，老师们真正相信我，我也不会害怕他们。Dr. Oakley的语气、面部表情和肢体动作让我感受到一种安全感和真实性，这对我来说非常重要。

I have learned in this course various ideas about how habit, pain avoidance, procrastination have all made my depression and anxiety worse. Yes I knew these things 'intuitively' but to have them presented by a professor from a major institution working in a non-mental health domain while simultaneously providing us links to numerous  research articles and doing this all with a gentle and encouraging voice and approach has made all the difference to me. (I also do not underestimate the value of 'good timing', meaning the timing/occasion of coming across this course and its approach to learning strategies in this stage of my life is fortunate.) Knowing that Dr. Oakley was faced with her own challenges and discomfort when learning math to which she applied self compassion and kindness alongside science and theory makes the messages and concepts taught in her lectures quite believable.  Dr. Oakley actually comes across as though she practices what she preaches and that makes a huge difference in the eyes of individuals who have tried a whole gamut of techniques and in some ways feel they are always being sold the ‘next bill of goods’.

我在这门课程中学到了关于习惯、痛苦回避、拖延如何加剧我的抑郁和焦虑的各种见解。是的，我“直觉上”知道这些事情，但由一位主要学术机构的教授用非心理健康领域的视角来阐述这些内容，同时提供了大量研究文章链接，并用温和鼓励的语气传递这些信息，这对我来说完全不同。了解Dr. Oakley在学习数学时也面临过挑战，并对自己施以自我同情与科学理论结合的实践，让她在讲座中传达的内容更加令人信服。

I am so moved by this course and the way the material was presented. The additional lectures/interviews with third parties and other professors at other institutions has further made me trust Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski and believe in the material and therefore really apply it to my own life.  To be willing to summon up the 'will power' to make a different choice when the cue is presented is very challenging when battling major depression etc, but it is not impossible and I am so thankful to the instructors, TA's and everyone participating in this course.

这门课程中提供的额外讲座以及与第三方和其他大学教授的访谈进一步增强了我对Dr. Oakley和Dr. Sejnowski的信任，也让我更加相信这些内容，并真正应用到自己的生活中。当面对触发点时，要鼓起“意志力”选择不同的反应，这对正在与重度抑郁作斗争的人来说是极具挑战的，但并非不可能。我非常感激这门课程的老师、助教以及所有参与者。

(I am of course posting this anonymously because of the stigma around the topics.  Hey, if my own family and friends don't want to talk about it, you can pretty much understand what stigma is capable of doing.  So please forgive me for having to post anonymously.  I am sure there are other people in the same boat as me and I do not wish to disrespect them by posting Anon.  I hope they will understand.)

（由于这些话题的污名化，我当然是匿名发布的。如果连我的家人和朋友都不愿意谈论这些问题，那么你大概可以理解污名化的威力。因此，请原谅我的匿名。我相信还有许多像我一样的人，我并不希望通过匿名发布对他们表示不尊重，我希望他们能够理解。）

So for me, this course is life changing in a very fundamental way.  I will never look at the diagnosis of 'depression, anxiety, PTSD’ the same again. I am seeing and feeling in myself all sorts of links between experiential avoidance, pain tolerance and reaction to cues and I am wondering how many others like me are battling the medical system and mental health care system and we just haven't come across the message in a way that has made sense to us.  I feel there are many of us that can benefit from a course like this focused on habits, concentration modes, memory, response to cue, pain tolerance etc from a 'general learning' standpoint rather than a 'mental health' standpoint, in order to understand and make links to our own experience.  Getting these messages presented in a different way, a different context has hit home for me.  THANK YOU, more than I can articulate in this post.

对我而言，这门课程在非常基础的层面上改变了我的生活。我将永远不会以同样的方式看待“抑郁、焦虑、PTSD”的诊断。我在自己身上看到了许多关于体验性回避、痛苦耐受力和对触发的反应之间的联系。我在想，有多少像我这样的人正在与医疗系统和心理健康系统作斗争，只是还没有遇到能够以让我们理解的方式传递信息的机会。我相信有许多人可以从这样一门关注习惯、注意力模式、记忆、触发反应和痛苦耐受力的课程中受益，而不是从“心理健康”角度出发，而是从“普通学习”角度来理解并与自己的经验建立联系。用一种不同的方式和背景传递这些信息，让我深有感触。

### 2.1 Introduction to Chunking.

This week, we're going to be talking about `chunks`, **compact packages of information that your mind can easily access**. We'll talk about how you can form chunks, how you can use them to improve your understanding of, and creativity with the material, and how chunks can help you do better on tests. We'll also talk about `illusions of competence in learning`. This was **when you're using ineffective study methods that fool your mind into thinking you're learning something when you're mostly just wasting your time**. We'll cover what* those less effective study methods* are and tell you what methods research has shown will work better to help you in your studies. Finally we'll talk about something called `overlearning`, **which can solidly ingrain information in your mind, but also can be a little like digging deeper ruts as you might spin your wheels ineffectively in learning.** You can make your study time more valuable by `interleaving`, **providing intelligent variety in your studies**. I'm Barbara Oakley. Thanks for learning how to learn.

本周我们将讨论“`组块`”，即你的**大脑可以轻松访问的紧凑信息包**。我们将谈论如何形成组块，如何利用它们来提高你对学习内容的理解和创造力，以及组块如何帮助你在考试中表现更好。我们还将讨论学习中的“`能力错觉`”。这就是**当你使用无效的学习方法时，它们会让你误以为自己在学习某些东西，但实际上你只是浪费时间**。我们会介绍那些*效果较差的学习方法*，并告诉你研究表明哪些方法更有效地帮助你学习。最后，我们将讨论一种叫做“`过度学习`”的现象，它**可以稳固地将信息铭记在大脑中，但也可能像在学习中无效地原地打转一样加深刻板印象**。通过`交错学习`，**提供智能化的多样性，可以让你的学习时间更有价值**。我是芭芭拉·奥克利，感谢你学习如何学习。

### 2.2 What is a Chunk?

In this video, we're going to answer the question. What is a `chunk`? *When you first look at a brand new concept it sometimes doesn't make much sense*, as shown by the jumbled puzzle pieces here. **Chunking is the mental leap that helps you unite bits of information together through meaning.** The new logical whole makes the chunk easier to remember, and also makes it easier to fit the chunk into the larger picture of what you're learning. *Just memorizing a fact without understanding or context doesn't help you understand what's really going on or how the concept fits together with other concepts you're learning*. Notice there are no interlocking puzzle edges on the puzzle piece to help you fit it to other pieces. We talked earlier about working memory and how those `four slots of working memory` appear to hang out in the part of your brain right behind your forehead known as the prefrontal cortex. When you're focusing your attention on something it's almost as if you have an octopus. The octopus of attention that slips its tentacles through those four slots of working memory when necessary to help you make connections to information that you might have in various parts of your brain. Remember, *this is different from the random connections of the diffuse mode*. *Focusing your attention to connect parts of the brain to tie together ideas is an important part of the focused mode of learning. It is also often what helps get you started in creating a chunk.*

在这个视频中，我们将回答一个问题：什么是`组块`？当你*第一次接触一个全新的概念时，它有时并没有太多意义*，就像这里杂乱无章的拼图块一样。**组块是一种心智飞跃，它帮助你通过意义将信息片段联系起来**。新的逻辑整体使组块更容易记忆，也更容易将其融入到你正在学习的更大背景中。*仅仅记住一个没有理解或背景的事实，并不能帮助你理解实际发生了什么，或者这个概念如何与其他（正在学习的）概念联系起来*。注意到拼图块上没有互锁的边缘来帮助你将它们拼接到其他部分。我们之前讨论过工作记忆以及这四个工作记忆“槽位”位于大脑前额皮层的部分。当你专注于某件事时，就好像你有一只“注意力章鱼”，它在必要时将触手伸入这`四个工作记忆槽位`，以帮助你连接大脑中可能存储的各种信息。*这与发散模式中的随机连接不同*。*专注于将大脑各部分联系起来以整合想法，是专注模式学习的重要组成部分，这也常常是你开始创建组块的方式*。

Interestingly **when you're stressed your attentional octopus begins to lose the ability to make some of those connections**. This is why your brain doesn't seem to work right when you're angry, stressed, or afraid. **Chunks are pieces of information**, neuroscientifically speaking, **through bound together through meaning or use**. You can take the letters P-O and P and bind them together into one conceptual easy to remember chunk, the word pop.. It's like converting a, a cumbersome computer file into a ZIP file. Underneath that single pop chunk is a symphony of neurons that have learned to sing in tune with one another. The complex neural activity that ties together our simplifying abstract chunks of thought. Whether those thoughts pertain to acronyms, ideas, or concepts are the basis of much of the science, literature, and art.

有趣的是，**当你感到压力时，你的“注意力章鱼”开始失去连接的能力**。这就是为什么当你生气、紧张或害怕时，你的大脑似乎无法正常工作。*组块是信息片段*，从神经科学的角度来说，*通过意义或使用联系在一起*。你可以将字母P-O和P组合成一个易于记忆的组块，即“pop”这个词。这就像将一个繁琐的计算机文件转换成ZIP文件。在那个“pop”组块的背后，是一场神经元的交响曲，它们学会了彼此协调，产生了复杂的神经活动，将抽象的思维组块简化并联系在一起。无论这些想法涉及的是首字母缩写、概念还是思想，组块是科学、文学和艺术的基础。

 Let's say you want to learn how to speak Spanish. If you're a child hanging around a Spanish speaking household, learning Spanish is as natural as breathing. Your mother says, mama. And you say, mama, right back to her. Your neurons fire and wire together in a shimmering mental loop cementing the relationship in your mind between the sound mama and your mother's smiling face. That scintillating neural loop is one memory trace, which is connected, of course, to many other related memory traces. The best programs for learning language, such as those of the Defense Language Institute where I learned Russian, incorporate `structured practice` that includes repetition and rote focus mode learning of the language along with more diffuse-like free speech with native speakers. *The goal is to embed the basic words and patterns so you can speak as `freely` and `creatively` in your new language as you do in your native language*.

比如说你想学习如何讲西班牙语。如果你是一个在西班牙语家庭长大的孩子，学习西班牙语就像呼吸一样自然。你的妈妈说：“mama”，你也回应说：“mama”。你的神经元在闪烁的脑回路中发射并相互连接，将“mama”这个声音和你母亲的微笑面孔联系在一起。这个闪烁的神经回路就是一个记忆痕迹，它当然与许多其他相关的记忆痕迹相连接。最好的语言学习项目，如我学习俄语的国防语言学院项目，包含`结构化的练习`，其中包括语言的重复和专注模式学习，以及与母语者的类似发散模式的自由交流。*目标是嵌入基本的词汇和模式，使你能够像母语一样`自由地`、`创造性地`使用你的新语言*。

As it turns out one of the first steps towards gaining expertise in academic topics is to create conceptual chunks, mental leaps that unite scattered bits of information through meaning. *The concept of neural chunks* also applies to sports, music, dance, *really just about anything that humans can get good at.* Basically, a chunk means a network of neurons that are used to firing together so you can think a thought or perform an action smoothly and effectively. Focused practice and repetition, the creation of strong memory traces, helps you to create chunks. The path to expertise is built little by little, small chunks can become larger, and all of the expertise serves to underpin more creative interpretations as you gradually become a master of the material. In other words, as you'll see later, practice and repetition in building chunks aren't all you need to become a truly creative master of the material you're learning. Chunking helps your brain run more efficiently. Once you chunk an idea, a concept, or an action, you don't know need to remember all the little underlying details. You've got the main idea, the chunk, and that's enough. It's like getting dressed in the morning. You just think one simple thought like, I'll get dressed, but it's amazing when you realize the complex swirl of underlying activities that take place with that one, simple chunk of thought. Next, we'll talk about how you can form a chunk. I'm Barbara Oakley. Thanks for learning how to learn.

事实证明，掌握学术主题的第一步之一就是创建概念性组块，即通过意义将分散的信息片段联系起来的心智飞跃。*神经组块的概念*同样适用于体育、音乐、舞蹈，实际上*几乎适用于人类可以精通的任何领域*。基本上，组块意味着一组习惯性共同激发的神经元网络，这样你就可以顺畅而有效地思考或行动。专注的练习和重复、强大记忆痕迹的形成，帮助你创建组块。通往专业技能的路径是逐渐构建的，小组块可以变得更大，所有的专业知识都支撑着你逐渐成为这一领域的专家。换句话说，正如你稍后将看到的，构建组块的练习和重复并不是成为真正创造性专家的全部。组块帮助你的大脑更高效运作。一旦你将一个想法、概念或动作形成组块，你就不需要记住所有的细节。你已经掌握了主要思想，即组块，这就足够了。这就像早上穿衣服，你只需要一个简单的想法，比如“我要穿衣服”，但当你意识到这个简单的组块背后有多么复杂的活动时，简直令人惊叹。接下来，我们将讨论如何形成一个组块。我是芭芭拉·奥克利，感谢你学习如何学习。

### 2.3 How to form a Chunk – Part 1

In this video, we're going to give you a little background about how to make a chunk. If you're learning to play a difficult song on the guitar, the neural representation of the song in your mind can be considered as **a rather large chunk**. You would first listen to the song. Maybe you'd even watch someone else playing the song especially if you were just a beginner who was learning things like, how to hold the guitar. Getting an initial sense of the pattern you want to master for yourself is similar for most subjects or skills. You often have to grasp little bits of songs that become **neuro mini-chunks**, which will later **join together into larger chunks**.

在这个视频中，我们将为您提供一些关于如何创建“块”的背景知识。如果您在学习弹一首难度较高的吉他曲子，脑中对这首曲子的神经表征可以被视为**一个相当大的“块”**。首先，您会听这首歌，可能还会看别人弹，尤其是当您只是一个刚学习如何拿吉他的初学者时。获得自己想要掌握的模式的初步印象对大多数学科或技能来说是相似的。您通常需要掌握歌曲的一小部分，这些部分会成为**神经小块**，随后逐渐**组合成较大的块**。

For example, over several days, you might learn how to smoothly place the musical passages on a guitar, and when you've grasped those passages, you could join them together with other passages that you've learned, gradually putting everything together so you can play the song. In learning a sport, say basketball, soccer, golf. You grasp and master various bits and pieces of the skills you need. You're creating little neural mini-chunks that you can then **gradually knit together into larger neural chunks**. Later you can hit those larger chunks into still larger and more complex chunks that you can draw up in an instant, in reaction to say to a slight, shift and twist in a soccer ball that's coming your way.

例如，在几天内，您可能会学习如何流畅地弹奏吉他上的音乐片段，当您掌握了这些片段后，您可以将它们与其他学过的片段组合在一起，逐渐将所有片段整合起来，这样您就可以演奏整首歌曲了。在学习运动时，例如篮球、足球、高尔夫，您掌握并精通各种所需的技能片段，创建神经小块，随后可以**逐渐将它们组合成更大的神经块**。稍后，您可以将这些较大的块组合成更大、更复杂的块，以便在瞬间调用，比如应对朝您飞来的足球的轻微转向和旋转。

**The best chunks are the ones that are so well ingrained, that you don't even have to consciously think about connecting the neural pattern together**. *That, actually, is the point of making complex ideas, movements or reactions into a single chunk.* You can see this in language learning. In the beginning often just saying a single word with the proper nuance, tone and accent involves a lot of practice. *Stringing extemporaneous sentences together involves the ability to creatively mix together various complex mini-chunks and chunks in the new language*.

**最好的块是那些已经深入内心，不需要有意识地思考如何连接神经模式的块。***这实际上就是将复杂的想法、动作或反应变成单一块的意义所在*。在语言学习中，您可以看到这种情况。刚开始时，往往只是说一个词，并且带有正确的语气、音调和口音，这都需要大量练习。而*能够即兴地组合句子，则需要能够在新语言中创造性地混合使用各种复杂的小块和块*。

To see what I mean, try repeating the following tongue-twister in the Indian language of Kannada：

Hi, I am Shilpa Konkani. I am native speaker of Kannada which is one of the oldest language spoken in India. Today, I'm going share with you a tongue-twister in Kannada. So let's get started. Terikere yri male muru kari kurimari meyuthiddavu.

为了理解这一点，您可以尝试用印度的卡纳达语重复以下绕口令：

嗨，我是Shilpa Konkani。我是卡纳达语的母语者，这是印度最古老的语言之一。今天，我要和大家分享一个卡纳达语的绕口令。那么，开始吧：Terikere yri male muru kari kurimari meyuthiddavu。

Not easy, is it? Unless you are a native speaker of Kannada, but the language was learned bit by bit.

并不容易，是吧？除非您是卡纳达语的母语者，但这种语言就是一点一点学会的。

Learning in math and science involves the same approach. When you're learning new math and science material, *you're often given sample problems with worked out solutions*. This is because, **when you're first trying to understand how to work a problem, you have a heavy `cognitive load`.** So **it helps to start out with a work through example**. It's like first listening to a song before trying to play the song yourself. Most of the details of the work out solution are right there, and your job is simply to figure out why the steps are taken the way they are. They can help you see the key features, and underline principles of a problem.

学习数学和科学也涉及同样的方法。当您学习新的数学和科学材料时，通常会给出*带有解答过程的示例题*。这是因为当您**第一次尝试理解如何解决问题时，`认知负荷`会很重**，因此**从带有解答过程的示例题开始是有帮助的**。就像在自己弹奏歌曲之前先听一遍一样。大部分解题过程的细节都已经展现在您面前，您的任务就是弄清楚为什么每一步要这样做。这些示例可以帮助您看到问题的关键特征和基本原则。

*One concern about using worked out examples in math and science to help you in starting to form chunks, is that it can be all too easy to focus too much on why an individual step works and not on the connection between steps*. That is, on why this particular step is the next thing you should do. So keep in mind that I'm not just talking about a cookie-cutter, just-do-as-you're told, mindless approach when following a worked-out solution. It's more like using a road map to help you when traveling to a new place. Pay attention to what's going on around you when you're using the map, and soon you'll find yourself able to get there on your own. You'll even be able to figure out new ways of getting there.

在数学和科学中*使用带有解答过程的示例题以帮助开始形成块时，有一个担忧是：很容易过于专注于每一个步骤的原因，而忽略了步骤之间的联系*，即为什么这个特定的步骤是您应该采取的下一步。所以请记住，我说的并不是一种“按部就班、照章行事”的无意识方法，而是像使用地图去新地方旅行时那样。使用地图时留意周围的情况，很快您就会自己找到路线，甚至能够找到新的到达方式。

Next, we'll walk you through the actual steps of chunk formation. I'm Barbara Oakley. Thanks for learning how to learn.

接下来，我们将带您走过块形成的实际步骤。我是Barbara Oakley，感谢您学习如何学习。

#Hey little girl sometimes the times get hard but soon #the storm will pass and you'll be playing in the yard. #Hey little girl sometimes you might feel sad but some #day you'll realize it really ain't that bad. Just part of growing up.

#嘿，小女孩，有时候日子会很艰难，但很快风暴就会过去，你会在院子里玩耍。 #嘿，小女孩，有时候你可能会感到难过，但总有一天你会意识到其实没有那么糟。这只是成长的一部分。

### 2.4 How to Form a Chunk – Part 2 *

In this video I'm going to walk you through the basic steps behind how to make a chunk. Every discipline is a little different. Chunking in the subject of history, for example, is quite different from chunking in chemistry or in karate. In my explanations here, I'm going to *lean a little more towards explaining chunking of mental ideas rather than physical body motions. But you'll see that the two approaches are closely related.* So, whether you're learning something mental or something physical, you'll find some helpful ideas here.

在这个视频中，我将向您介绍如何创建“块”的基本步骤。每个学科都有一些不同。比如，历史中的分块与化学或空手道中的分块是非常不同的。在这里的解释中，我会更多地*倾向于解释如何分割心理上的想法，而不是身体的动作，但您会看到这两种方法是密切相关的。*因此，无论您是在学习心理上的东西还是身体上的东西，您都会在这里找到一些有用的想法。

**The first step on chunking is simply to focus your undivided attention on the information you want to chunk.** *If you had the television going on in the background, or you're looking up every few minutes to check or answer your phone or computer messages, it means you're going to have more difficulty in making a chunk, because your brain is not really focusing on chunking the new material.* **When you first begin to learn something, you're making new neural patterns and connecting them with pre-existing patterns that are spread through many areas of the brain**. Your octopus tentacles, so to speak, can't reach very well if some of them are off on other thoughts using up some of the limited slots in your working memory.

**分块的第一步就是`集中注意力`在您想要分块的信息上。***如果您在背景中开着电视，或者每隔几分钟就抬头查看或回复手机或电脑信息，那么这意味着您在创建“块”时会遇到更多困难，因为您的大脑实际上并没有专注于分块新材料*。当您**第一次开始学习某些东西时，您是在创建新的神经模式并将它们与大脑中许多区域中预先存在的模式连接起来**。如果有些神经“触角”偏离了、在想其他事情，这会*占用工作记忆中的一些有限位置*，那么它们就无法很好地连接。

**The second step in chunking is `to understand` the basic idea you're trying to chunk**, whether it's understanding a concept such as continental drift, seeing the connection between the basic elements of the plot for a story, grasping the economic principle of supply and demand, or comprehending the essence of a particular type of math problem. *Students can often synthesize the gist*; that is figure out the main idea or ideas, pretty naturally. Or at least they can grasp those ideas if they allow the focused and diffuse modes of thinking to take turns in helping them figure out what's going on. *Understanding is like a superglue that helps hold the underlying memory traces together*. It creates broad encompassing traces that can link to other memory traces.

**分块的第二步是`理解`您试图分块的基本概念**，无论是理解像大陆漂移这样的概念，看到故事情节中基本元素之间的联系，掌握供需经济原理，还是理解某种数学问题的本质。学生们通常可以综合出要点，也就是说，自然而然地找出主要想法，或者至少他们可以理解这些想法，如果他们让专注和发散的思维模式轮流帮助他们弄清发生了什么。*理解就像是一种超级胶水，帮助维持底层记忆痕迹的联系*，它创造了广泛的记忆痕迹，可以链接到其他记忆痕迹。

Can you create a chunk if you **don't understand**? Yes, but it's often a `useless chunk` that won't fit in with, or relate to other material of your learning. That said, **it's important to realize that just understanding how a problem was solved, for example, does not necessarily create a chunk that you can easily call to mind later. Don't confuse the "Aha!" of a breakthrough in understanding, with solid expertise.** That's part of why you can grasp an idea when a teacher presents it in class, but if you don't review it fairly soon after you first learned it, it can seem incomprehensible when it comes time to prepare for a test. *In math and science related subjects, closing the book and testing yourself on whether you, yourself, can solve the problem you think you understand, will speed up your learning at this stage.* You often realize `the first time you actually understand something is when you can actually do it yourself`.

如果**不理解**，能否创建“块”？可以，但这通常是一个`无用的块`，与您学习的其他材料不搭配，也没有关系。也就是说，**重要的是要意识到，仅仅理解问题是如何被解决的，并不一定意味着您能够轻松记住它。不要把“啊哈！”的理解突破和牢固的专业知识混为一谈。**这也是为什么在课堂上老师讲解时您可以掌握一个想法，但如果在第一次学习之后不及时复习，准备考试时它就会显得难以理解。*在数学和科学相关的学科中，合上书本，自测一下自己是否能够解决您认为自己已经理解的问题，会加快您在这个阶段的学习。*通常您会意识到，`第一次真正理解某件事是在您自己能够亲自完成它的时候`。

It's the same in many disciplines, just looking at someone else's painting doesn't mean you could actually create that painting yourself, and just hearing a song won't give you the expertise you need to sing it in the same resonant fashion. Just because you see it or even that you understand it, it doesn't mean that you can actually do it. **Only doing it yourself helps create the neural patterns that underlie true mastery**.

这在许多学科中都是一样的，仅仅看别人的画作并不意味着您自己可以创作出同样的画作，仅仅听到一首歌也不足以让您掌握以同样的共鸣方式演唱它的技能。仅仅因为您看到它，甚至理解它，并不意味着您可以真正做到它。**只有自己亲自去做，才能帮助建立支持真正掌握的神经模式**。

**The third step to chunking is `gaining context`**, so you can see not just how, but also when to use this chunk. *Context means going beyond the initial problem and seeing more broadly, repeating and practicing with both related and unrelated problems, so that you can see not only when to use the chunk, but when not to use it*. This helps you see how your newly formed chunk fits into the bigger picture. In other words, you may have a tool in your strategy or problem solving tool box, but if you don't know when to use that tool, it's not going to do you a lot of good.

**分块的第三步是`获得情境`**，这样您不仅可以看到如何使用这个块，还可以看到什么时候使用它。*情境意味着超越最初的问题，进行更广泛的理解，通过重复和练习与相关和不相关的问题，您不仅能看到什么时候使用这个块，还能看到什么时候不使用它*。这有助于您了解新创建的块如何融入更大的图景中。换句话说，您可能在您的策略或问题解决工具箱中有一个工具，但如果您不知道什么时候使用该工具，它就不会对您有太大的帮助。

Ultimately, `practice` helps you **broaden the networks of neurons that are connected to your chunk, ensuring it's not only firm, but also accessible from many different paths**. *As you can see from this top down, bottom up illustration, learning takes place in two ways. There's a bottom up chunking process, where practice and repetition can help you both build and strengthen each chunk, so you can easily access it whenever you need to. And there's also a, a sort of a top down big picture process that allows you to see what you're learning and where it fits in. Both processes are vital in gaining mastery over the material*. **Context is where bottom up and top down learning meet**.

最终，通过`练习`，您可以**扩展与您的块相连接的神经元网络，确保它不仅牢固，而且可以通过`多种途径访问`**。*正如您从这个自上而下、自下而上的插图中所看到的，学习以两种方式进行。有一种`自下而上的分块过程`，通过练习和重复，您既可以建立也可以加强每一个块，以便在需要时轻松调用它。同时也有一种`自上而下的大图景过程`，让您看到自己所学内容及其位置。两种过程在掌握材料方面都至关重要*。**情境是自下而上和自上而下学习相结合的地方**。

![]({{site.img}}/lhtl/01.png)

To clarify here, **chunking may involve your learning how to use a certain problem-solving technique. Context means learning when to use that technique instead of some other technique**. *Doing a rapid two-minute picture walk through a chapter in a book before you begin studying it, glancing at pictures and section headings, can allow you to gain a sense of the big picture*. So can listening to a very well organized lecture. These kinds of activities can help you know `where to put the chunks` you're constructing, `how the chunks relate to one another`, just as you see here, with the image of the man in the car.

为了进一步澄清，**分块可能涉及您学习如何使用某种问题解决技术。情境则意味着学习什么时候使用这种技术而不是其他技术**。*在开始学习之前，快速进行两分钟的图片浏览，浏览书中的图片和章节标题，可以让您对大图景有所了解*。听一场组织得非常好的讲座也可以起到同样的效果。这些活动可以帮助您知道如何`安放您正在构建的块`，`块之间是如何相互关联的`，就像您在这里看到的汽车里的人一样。

**Learn the major concepts** or points first. These are often the key parts of a good instructor or book chapter's outline, flow charts, tables, or concept maps. Once you have this done, **fill in the details**. Even if a few of the puzzle pieces are missing at the end of your studies, you can **still see the big picture**.

**首先学习主要概念或要点**，这些通常是优秀教师或书本章节大纲、流程图、表格或概念图的关键部分。一旦完成这一步，**再填补细节**。即使在学习结束时还有一些拼图碎片缺失，您仍然可以看到整个图景。

So there you go! Summing it up, chunks are best built with focused attention, understanding of the basic idea, and practice to help you gain mastery and a sense of the big picture context. Those are the essential steps in making a chunk and fitting that chunk into a greater conceptual overview of what you're learning. But there's more. I'm Barbara Oakley. Thanks for learning how to learn.

好了，就是这样！总结一下，最好的块是通过专注的注意力、对基本思想的理解，以及实践帮助您获得掌握和对大图景情境的感知来建立的。这些是创建块并将该块融入到您正在学习的更大概念概览中的基本步骤。但这并不是全部。我是Barbara Oakley，感谢您学习如何学习。

### 2.5 Illusions of Competence *

In this video, we're going to talk about some essential ideas in getting your learning on track. The importance of `recall`, `illusions of competence` in learning. `Mini-testing` and t`he value of making mistakes`. *One of the most common approaches for trying to learn material from a book or from notes is simply to `reread` it*. But psychologist, Jeffrey Karpicke, has shown that this approach is actually much less productive than another, very simple, technique. `Recall`. **After you've read the material, simply look away, and see what you can recall from the material you've just read**. Karpicke's research, published in the Journal Science, provided solid evidence along these lines. Students studied a scientific text and then practiced it, *by recalling as much of the information as they could. Then they re-studied the text and recalled it again*. That is, they tried to remember the key ideas, once more. The results, in the same amount of time, by simply practicing and recalling the material students learned far more and at a much deeper level than they did using any other approach. Including simply rereading the text a number of times. Or drawing concept maps that supposedly enrich the relationships in the materials under study. This improved learning comes whether students take a formal test, or just informally test themselves. This gives an important reminder. When we retrieve knowledge, we're not just being mindless robots. **The retrieval process itself enhances deep learning, and helps us to begin forming chunks**. It's almost as if the recall process helps **build in little** `neural hooks`, **that we can hang our thinking on**.

在本视频中，我们将讨论一些帮助你让学习步入正轨的重要概念：`回忆的重要性`、学习中的`能力错觉`、`小测试`以及`犯错的价值`。*很多人尝试从书本或笔记中学习的常用方法只是简单地`重读`内容*，但心理学家杰弗里·卡皮克（Jeffrey Karpicke）发现，这种方法实际上远不如另一种非常简单的方法——`回忆`。**读完材料后，简单地移开视线，看看你能回忆起刚才阅读的内容**。卡皮克在《科学》杂志上发表的研究提供了有力的证据。学生们学习了一篇科学文本，然后*通过回忆尽可能多的信息来练习，然后再复习文本并再次回忆*，也就是说，他们再次尝试记住关键内容。结果显示，在相同的时间内，简单地练习和回忆材料，学生们的学习效果比任何其他方法，包括重复阅读文本或绘制概念图等要好得多。这种改进的学习效果无论是通过正式测试还是自我测试，都可以实现。这提醒我们，**当我们回忆知识时，不仅仅是机械地重复，而是回忆过程本身在加深学习并帮助形成知识块**。回忆过程好像帮助我们在思维上**建立了小的**`神经钩子`，**让我们能够挂靠思维**。

Even more of a surprise to researchers, was that *the students themselves predicted that simply reading and recalling the materials, wasn't the best way to learn*. They thought, **concept mapping, drawing diagrams that show the relationship between the concepts would be the best**. But *if you're trying to build connections between chunks, before the basic chunks are embedded in the brain, it doesn't work as well*. It's like trying to learn advanced strategy in chess, before you even understand the basic concepts of how the pieces move. Using `recall`, `mental retrieval of the key idea`s, rather than `passive rereading`, will make your study time more focused and effective. **The only time rereading text seems to be effective, is if you let time pass between the rereading**, so that it becomes more of an exercise in spaced repetition. One way to think about this type of learning and recall, is shown right here. As we mentioned earlier, *there are four or so slots, in working memory. When you're first learning how to understand a concept, or technique to solve a problem, your entire working memory is involved in the process. As shown by this sort of, mad tangle of connections between the four slots of working memory. As you begin to chunk the concept, you will feel it connecting more easily and smoothly in your mind. Once the concept is chunked, it takes up only one slot in working memory. It simultaneously becomes one smooth strand that's easy to follow, and to use to make new connections. The rest of your working memory is left clear. That dangling strand of chunked material has, in some sense, increased the amount of information available to your working memory. It's as if the slot in working memory is a hyperlink that's been connected to a great big web page.*

研究人员更为惊讶的是，*学生们自己预测简单阅读和回忆材料不是最好的学习方法，**他们认为绘制概念图并通过图解展示概念间的关系会更有效***。但如果你*在基本知识块还没在大脑中扎根之前就尝试建立联系，这样的效果不会好*。这就像试图在你还不理解棋子如何移动的基础上学习高级的国际象棋策略一样。使用`回忆`、即`关键概念的心理提取`，而不是`被动重读`，会让你的学习更集中有效。**唯一有效的重读方式是让时间间隔开来，这样就成为一种间隔重复练习的形式**。我们可以用这种学习与回忆的方法来理解，*工作记忆中大约有四个左右的槽位。当你第一次学习一个概念或解决问题的技术时，你的整个工作记忆都会被这个过程占据。随着你开始块化这个概念，你会感觉它在脑海中变得更容易和流畅。一旦概念被块化，它在工作记忆中只占一个槽位，同时成为一个易于跟随的流畅链条，用来建立新的联系。剩下的工作记忆空间被清空。这个块化材料的悬挂链条在某种意义上增加了你工作记忆中的可用信息量。就好像工作记忆中的槽位成为了一个超级链接，连接到一个庞大的网页。*

Now `you` understand why it is key that you are the one doing the problem solving or mastering the concept. Not whoever wrote the solution manual, or book, on whatever subject you're studying. If you just look at the solution, for example, then tell yourself. Oh yeah, I see **why `they` did that**. Then the solution is not really yours. *You've done almost nothing to knit those concepts into your own underlying neural circuitry*. **Merely glancing at a solution and thinking you truly know it yourself is one of the most common illusions of competence in learning**. You must have the information persisting in your memory if you're to master the material well enough to do well on tests and to think creatively with it.

因此，`你`是解决问题或掌握概念的关键，而不是写了解答手册或书籍的人。如果你只是看解答，然后对自己说：“哦，我明白`他们`**为什么这么做**了”，那么这个解答并不真正属于你。你*几乎没有做任何工作将这些概念编织到自己的神经回路中*。**仅仅浏览答案并认为自己已经掌握它，是学习中最常见的能力错觉之一**。要想在考试中表现出色并创造性地运用所学知识，你必须将信息持久地存储在记忆中。

In a related thing, **you may be surprised to learn that highlighting and underlining must be done very carefully. Otherwise it can not only be ineffective, but also misleading**. It's as if, making lots of motions with your hand can fool you into thinking you've placed the concept in your brain. If you do mark up the text, try to look for main ideas before making any marks. And try to **keep your underlining or highlighting to a minimum**. One sentence or less per paragraph. On the other hand, **words or notes in a margin that synthesize key concepts are a very good idea**. Jeff Karpicke, the same researcher who's done such important work related to recall, has also done research on a related topic. `Illusions of competence` in learning. *The reason students like to keep rereading their notes or a textbook, is that when they have the book or Google open right in front of them, it provides the illusion that the material is also in their brains. But it's not, because it can be easier to look at the book instead of recalling, students persist in their illusions studying in a way that just isn't very effective.*

另外，你可能会惊讶地发现，**做标记和划线需要非常小心，否则它不仅无效，还可能具有误导性**。大量的手部动作可能会让你误以为已经将概念记在了脑海中。如果确实要标记文本，先找出主要思想再做标记，尽量**保持标记或划线的最小化**，每段最多标记一句话。另一方面，**在页边空白处写下对关键概念的总结是非常好的方法**。卡皮克博士，这位在回忆方面做出重要研究的学者，也在相关主题上进行了研究，即学习中的`能力错觉`。*学生们之所以喜欢重复阅读笔记或教科书，是因为当书本或谷歌就在面前时，提供了一种材料也在大脑中的错觉。但事实并非如此，因为查看书本比回忆更容易，学生们坚持以这种低效的方式学习。*

This is a reminder that just wanting to learn the material, and spending a lot of time with it, doesn't guarantee you'll actually learn it. **A super helpful way to make sure you're learning and not fooling yourself with illusions of competence, is to `test` yourself on whatever you're learning.** In some sense, **that's what `recall` is actually doing**. **Allowing you to see whether or not you really grasp an idea**. If you make a mistake in what you are doing, it's actually a very good thing. You want to try not to repeat you mistakes, of course, but **mistakes are very valuable** to make in your little self-tests before high stakes real tests. *Because they allow you to make repairs and you're thinking flaws bit by bit mistakes help correct your thinking, so that you can learn better and do better.*

这是一个提醒，仅仅想学习材料并花大量时间并不保证你真的学会了。**一种确保你真正学习而不是欺骗自己的能力的有效方法，就是`测试`自己所学的内容**。从某种意义上讲，这**也是`回忆`**在做的事，**让你看到自己是否真正理解了一个想法**。如果在学习中犯错，实际上是件好事。当然你要尽量避免重复错误，但在高风险考试前的小测试中**犯错非常有价值**，*因为它们可以让你逐步修正思维中的错误，从而帮助你更好地学习并表现更出色*。

As you know now `recall` is a powerful tool. But here's another tip, **recalling material when you are outside your usual place of study can also help you strengthen your grasp of the material**. You don't realize it, but when you are learning something new you can often take in subliminal cues for the room and the space around you at the time you were originally learning the material. This can throw you off when you take tests because you often take tests in a room that's different from the room you were learning in. By recalling and thinking about the material when you are in various physical environment, you **become independent of the cues from any one given location**. That helps you avoid the problem of the test room being different from where you originally learned the material. I'm Barbara Oakley, thanks for learning about learning.

现在你已经知道`回忆`是一种强大的工具，但这里还有另一个建议：**在不同于平时学习的地方回忆材料也可以帮助你加强对材料的掌握**。你可能没有意识到，当你学习新事物时，你可能会无意识地吸收周围房间和空间的暗示。这会在考试时影响你，因为你通常会在不同于学习的房间里考试。通过在不同环境中回忆并思考材料，你可以**摆脱任何特定位置的暗示**，从而避免考试房间与学习房间不同的问题。我是芭芭拉·奥克利，谢谢你学习有关学习的内容。

### 2.6 What Motivates You?

Welcome back! **It is hard to learn when you're not into it**. But if it's something you're really interested in, learning is easy. Why is that? *Most of the neurons in your cortex carry information about what is happening around you and what you're doing. Your brain also has a set of diffusely projecting systems of `neuromodulators` [ˌnjʊərəʊˈmɒdjʊleɪtə], that carry information not about the content of an experience but its importance and value to your future, neuromodulators are chemicals that influence how a neurons responds to other neurons.* And today we will discuss three of them. `Acetylcholine`  [ˌæsɪtɪl'kɒli:n], `Dopamine` [ˈdəʊpəmiːn] and `Serotonin` [ˌsɪərəˈtəʊnɪn].

欢迎回来！**当你不感兴趣时，学习会很困难**。但如果是你真正感兴趣的事情，学习就变得轻松了。为什么会这样？*你大脑皮层中的大多数神经元传递的是你周围发生的事情和你在做的事情的信息。你的大脑还拥有一组广泛投射的`神经调质`系统，这些系统传递的不是体验的内容，而是它对未来的重要性和价值。神经调质是一些化学物质，它们会影响神经元对其他神经元的反应。*今天我们将讨论其中的三种：`乙酰胆碱`、`多巴胺`和`血清素`。

`Acetylcholine neurons` form `neuromodulatory connections` to the `cortex` that are particularly important for focused learning, **when you are paying close attention. These acetylcholine neurons project widely and activate circuits that control synaptic plasticity.** Leading to new long term memory. Neuromodulators also have a profound impact on your unconscious mind. One of the great brain discoveries in my life time, has been that **our motivation is controlled by a particular chemical substance called `Dopamine`**. *Which is found in a small set of neurons in our brain stem shown here in orange. These dopamine neurons are part of a large brain system that controls reward learning and in particular in the basal ganglia, which is located in the green region above the dopamine neurons and below the cortex at the top of the brain. Dopamine is released from these neurons, when we receive an unexpected reward. Dopamine signals project widely and have a very powerful effect on learning. And this is something that also affects decision-making. And even the value of sensory inputs.*

`乙酰胆碱神经元`在`皮层`中形成`神经调质连接`，对**集中的学习**特别重要:**当你专注时，这些乙酰胆碱神经元广泛投射，并激活控制突触可塑性的回路，导致新的长期记忆的形成。**神经调质也对你的潜意识有深远的影响。我一生中最重要的脑科学发现之一是，**动机是由一种叫`多巴胺`的化学物质控制的。***这些多巴胺神经元位于脑干的一个小区域，负责奖励学习，尤其是在基底神经节（位于多巴胺神经元上方的大脑绿色区域）。当我们获得意外的奖励时，多巴胺从这些神经元释放出来。多巴胺信号广泛投射，对学习有很强的影响，这也会影响决策以及感官输入的价值。*

`Dopamine` is **in the business of predicting future rewards and not just the immediate reward. This can motivate you to do something that may not be rewarding right now but will lead to a much better reward in the future**. Addictive drugs artificially increase dopamine activity and fool your brain into thinking that something wonderful has just happened. In fact just the opposite has just happened. This leads to craving and dependence, which can hijack your free will and can motivate actions that are harmful to you. Loss of `Dopamine neuron`s leads to a *lack of motivation; and something called anhedonia, which is a loss of interest in things that once gave you pleasure*. Severe loss of Dopamine neurons causes resting tremor, slowness, rigidity, this is called Parkinson's disease. Ultimately it leads to catatonia, a complete lack of any movement. Dopamine neurons are part of the unconscious part of your brain that you learned about in the first week. **When you promise to treat yourself something after a study section you are tapping into your dopamine system**.

`多巴胺`的作用**不仅在于预测未来的奖励，还能激励你去做一些现在可能不立即有回报的事情，但将来会有更好的回报**。成瘾性药物会人为增加多巴胺活动，欺骗你的大脑，以为有了美妙的体验，实际上恰恰相反。这会导致渴望和依赖，甚至会劫持你的自由意志，驱使你去做对自己有害的行为。`多巴胺神经元`的缺失会导致*缺乏动机，甚至出现快感缺乏症，即对曾经让你愉悦的事物失去兴趣*。严重缺失会导致静止性震颤、迟缓和僵硬，即帕金森病。最终可能发展为紧张症，即完全缺乏任何动作。**当你在学习后奖励自己时，其实就是在激活你的多巴胺系统**。

`Serotonin` is a third diffuse neuromodulatory system that strongly affects your `social life`. In monkey troops the alpha male has the highest level of serotonin activity and the lowest ranking male has the lowest levels. `Prozac`, which is prescribed for clinical depression, raises the level of Serotonin activity. The level of Serotonin is also closely linked to `risk taking behavior`. With higher risk in lower Serotonin monkeys. Inmates in jail for violent crimes have some of the lowest levels of serotonin activity in society.

`血清素`是第三种扩散性神经调质系统，它对你的`社交生活`有很大影响。在猴群中，首领雄性拥有最高的血清素活动，而地位最低的雄性拥有最低的血清素水平。`百忧解（Prozac）`是一种治疗抑郁症的药物，它可以提高血清素的活性。血清素水平还与`风险行为`密切相关，血清素水平较低的猴子风险行为更高。因暴力犯罪而入狱的犯人通常有社会中最低的血清素活动水平。

Finally **your emotions strongly affect learning as you are well aware**. Emotions were once thought to be separate from cognition but recent research has shown that emotions are intertwined with perception and attention and **interact with learning and memory**. The `amygdala` [ə'mɪɡdələ] an almond shaped structure shown here, nestled down at the base of the brain is one of the **major centers where cognition and emotion are effectively integrated**. The amygdala is part of the `limbic system` which together with `hippocampus` is involved in **processing memory and decision making** as well as regulating emotional reactions. **You will want to keep your amygdala happy to be an effective learner**. The emotions and your neuromodulatory systems are slower than perception and action but are no less important for successful learning.

最后，**你的情绪对学习有着强烈的影响**。情绪曾被认为与认知分离，但最新研究表明情绪与知觉和注意力交织在一起，并**与学习和记忆相互作用**。`杏仁核`是一个位于大脑底部的杏仁状结构，是**认知和情绪有效整合的主要中心**之一。杏仁核是`边缘系统`的一部分，和`海马`体一起参与**处理记忆、决策以及调节情绪反应**。**你需要保持杏仁核的愉悦，才能成为一个有效的学习者**。情绪和神经调质系统的反应速度虽比知觉和行动慢，但同样对成功学习至关重要。

### 2.7 The Value of a Library of Chunks

The ability to combine chunks in new and original ways underlies a lot of historical innovation. Bill Gates and other industry leaders set aside extended week-long reading periods so that they can hold many and varied ideas in mind during one time. *This helps generate their own innovative thinking by allowing fresh in mind not yet forgotten ideas to network amongst themselves.* Basically what people do to enhance their knowledge and gain expertise is to gradually build the number of chunks in their mind. Valuable bits of information, they can piece together in new and creative ways. Chess masters, for example, can easily access thousands of different chess patterns. Musicians, linguists and scientists can each access similar chunks of knowledge in their own disciplines. *The bigger and more well practiced your chunked mental library, whatever the subject you're learning, the more easily you'll be able to solve problems and figure out solutions.* As we'll discover soon, chunking isn't all you'll need to develop creative flexibility in your learning. But it's an important component. **Chunks can also help you understand new concepts.** This is because when you grasp one chunk, **you'll find that that chunk can be related in surprising ways to similar chunks, not only in that field, but also in very different fields.** This idea is called `transfer`. For example, concepts and problems solving methods you learned for physics can be very similar to chunked concepts in business. I've found some aspects of language learning were very helpful for me when I later began to learn Computer Programming.

将块状信息以新颖的方式组合在一起是许多历史创新的基础。比尔·盖茨和其他行业领袖会专门抽出一周的时间来阅读，使他们能够在同一时间内记住许多多样化的想法。这*有助于激发他们自己的创新思维，因为它允许新鲜、尚未被遗忘的想法在脑中相互联系*。基本上，人们通过逐渐在大脑中积累块状信息来增强知识并获得专业技能。它们是有价值的信息片段，可以被创意性地拼接在一起。例如，国际象棋大师能够轻松调用成千上万种不同的棋局模式。音乐家、语言学家和科学家也都可以在各自的学科中访问类似的块状知识。*无论你学习的主题是什么，你的块状信息库越大、练习得越熟练，解决问题和找到解决方案就越容易。*正如我们将要发现的，块状信息并不是你在学习中培养创造性灵活性的唯一要素，但它是一个重要组成部分。**块状信息还可以帮助你理解新概念**。这是因为，当你掌握一个块时，你**会发现这个块可以以令人惊讶的方式与类似的块相关联，不仅是在该领域内，还可以跨领域进行。**这种思想被称为`迁移`。例如，你在物理中学到的概念和问题解决方法可能与商业中的块状概念非常相似。我发现，学习语言的一些方面在我后来学习计算机编程时非常有帮助。

**A chunk is a way of compressing information much more compactly.** `As you gain more experience in chunking in particular subject, you'll see that the chunks you're able to create are bigger.` In some sense, that the ribbons are longer. Not only are those ribbons longer but the neural patterns are in some sense darker. *They're more solid and firmly ingrained. If you have a library of concepts and solutions internalized as chunked patterns, you can think of it as a collection or a library of neural patterns. When you're trying to figure something out, if you have a good library of these chunks, you can more easily skip to the right solution by metaphorically speaking, listening to whispers from your diffuse mode.* **Your diffuse mode can help you connect two or more chunks together in new ways to solve novel problems. Another way to think of it is this. As you build each chunk, it is filling in a part of your larger `knowledge picture`.** *But if you don't practice with your growing chunks, they can remain faint, and it's harder to put together the big picture of what you're trying to learn.* **In building a chunked library, you're training your brain to recognize not only a specific concept, but different types and classes of concepts so that you can automatically know how to solve quickly or handle whatever you encounter. You'll start to see `patterns that simplify problem solving` for you and will soon find that different solution techniques are lurking at the edge of your memory.** Before midterms or finals it can be easy to brush up and have these solutions at the mental ready.

**块状信息本质上是一种更紧凑地压缩信息的方式**。*随着你在特定学科中积累更多的块状经验，你会发现你能够创建的块变得更大。*某种意义上，它们就像更长的丝带。而且这些丝带不仅更长，*它们的神经模式在某种意义上也更深、更牢固。如果你有一个内化为块状模式的概念和解决方案库，你可以把它看作是一个神经模式的集合或图书馆。当你尝试解决问题时，如果你有一个良好的块状信息库，你就能更容易地跳到正确的解决方案，就像是隐约听到发散模式的低语。***发散模式可以帮助你以新的方式将两个或更多块连接在一起，以解决新问题。换个角度来看，当你构建每一个块时，它填补了你更大`知识图景`的一部分。***但是，如果你不练习逐渐增长的块状信息，它们可能会保持模糊，使你更难拼凑出你试图学习的整体图景。***在构建块状信息库的过程中，你是在训练你的大脑去识别不仅是特定概念，还有不同类型和类别的概念，这样你就可以自动知道如何快速解决或处理你遇到的任何情况。你会开始看到`简化问题解决的模式`，并很快发现不同的解决技巧在你的记忆边缘显现。**在期中考试或期末考试之前，复习这些解决方案会变得更容易，它们随时准备好供你使用。

**There are two ways to figure something out or to solve problems. First there's sequential step by step reasoning, and second through a more holistic intuition.** *Sequential thinking, where each small step leads deliberately towards a solution, involves the focused mode.* Intuition on the other hand often seems to require this creative diffuse mode linking of several seemingly different focused mode thoughts. **Most difficult problems and concepts are grasped through intuition, because these new ideas make a leap away from what you're familiar with.** Keep in mind that *the diffuse mode's semi-random way of making connections means that the solutions they provide should be very carefully verified using the focused mode. Intuitive insights aren't always correct.*

**解决问题有两种方式：一种是按顺序一步步推理，另一种是通过更整体的直觉。***按顺序的思维中，每个小步骤都有目的地指向解决方案，这涉及到专注模式。*而直觉往往需要这种创造性的发散模式，将几种看似不同的专注模式想法联系起来。**大多数困难的问题和概念是通过直觉掌握的，因为这些新想法需要跳出你熟悉的范畴。**然而，要记住，*发散模式以半随机的方式建立联系，这意味着它们提供的解决方案应通过专注模式仔细验证。直觉洞察并不总是正确的。*

You may think *there are so many problems and concepts, just in a single section or chapter of whatever you're studying, there's just no way to learn them all.* This is where the `law of serendipity` comes into play. `Lady luck favors the one who tries.` *Just focus on whatever section you're studying. You'll find that once you put that first problem or concept in your mental library, whatever it is, then the second concept will go in a little more easily. And the third more easily still.* Not that all of this is a snap, but it does *get easier*.

你可能会觉得，在你学习的任何章节或部分中*有太多的问题和概念，几乎无法全部掌握*。这时，`偶然性定律——“幸运女神眷顾努力的人”`——就起作用了。*专注于你正在学习的部分，你会发现，一旦你将第一个问题或概念放入你的心智库中，不管它是什么，第二个概念会更容易进入。第三个会更加容易。*这并不是说这整个过程一帆风顺，但它确实会变得*越来越轻松*。

I am Barbara Oakley. Thanks for learning about learning.

我是芭芭拉·奥克利。感谢你学习如何学习。

### 2.8 Overlearning, Chocking, Einstellung, and Interleaving

*When you're learning a new idea, for example a new vocabulary word or a new concept or a new problem solving approach, you sometimes tend to practice it over and over again during the same study session. A little of this is useful and necessary, but continuing to study or practice after you've mastered what you can in the session is called `overlearning`. Overlearning can have its place. It can produce an `automaticity` that can be important when you're executing a serve in tennis or a perfect piano concerto. If you choke on tests or public speaking, overlearning can be especially valuable.* You know that even expert public speakers practice on the order of 70 hours for a typical 20-minute TED Talk? *`Automaticity` can indeed be helpful in times of nervousness, but be wary of repetitive overlearning during a single session. Research has shown it can be a waste of valuable learning time. The reality is, once you've got the basic idea down during a session, continuing to hammer away at it during the same session doesn't strengthen the kinds of long term memory connections you want to have strengthened. Worse yet, focusing on one technique is a little like learning carpentry by only practicing with a hammer. After a while you think you can fix anything by just bashing at it.*

*当你学习一个新概念，比如一个新词汇、一个新概念或一个新的问题解决方法时，有时会倾向于在同一个学习阶段反复练习。适度的重复是有益和必要的，但在你已经掌握了这一阶段内容之后，继续学习或练习称为`过度学习`。过度学习在某些情况下是有价值的，它可以产生一种`自动性`，这在网球发球或完美的钢琴协奏曲时非常重要。如果你在考试或公众演讲时感到紧张，过度学习尤为重要*。你知道，即使是专家级的演讲者，通常也会为一个20分钟的TED演讲练习约70个小时吗？**在紧张的时候，`自动性`确实能带来帮助，但在一个学习阶段过度重复学习应当谨慎。研究表明，这可能浪费宝贵的学习时间**。*现实是，一旦你在一个阶段掌握了基本概念，**在同一个阶段继续反复琢磨并不会增强你所希望的长期记忆连接**。更糟的是，过于集中于一种技巧就像只用锤子学习木工。一段时间后，你会觉得通过猛砸就能修复任何东西。*

**Using a subsequent study session to repeat what you're trying to learn is just fine and often valuable. It can strengthen and deepen your chunked neuron patterns.** But be wary; repeating something you already know perfectly well, is, face it, easy. *It can also bring the `illusion of competence` that you've mastered the full range of material, when you've actually only mastered the easy stuff.* Instead, you want to balance your studies by deliberately focusing on what you find more difficult. *This focusing on the more difficult material is called `deliberate practice`. It's often what makes the difference between a good student and a great student*.

**使用后续的学习阶段来重复你正在学习的内容是完全可以的，而且通常很有价值。这可以增强和加深你的信息块神经模式。**但要小心；重复你已经非常熟悉的内容，其实是很容易的。*这也可能带来`知识错觉`，而实际上你只掌握了简单的部分*。相反，你需要通过有意识地关注更困难的内容来平衡你的学习。*这种关注更困难材料的方式被称为`刻意练习`。这往往是优秀学生和优秀学生之间的区别*。

All this is also related to a concept known as `Einstellung`. In this phenomenon, **your initial simple thought, an idea you already have in mind or a neural pattern you've already developed and strengthened, may prevent a better idea or solution from being found.** We saw this in the focus pinball picture, where your initial pinball of thought went to the upper part of the brain, but the solution thought pattern was in the lower part. The crowded bumpers of the focus mode and the previous patterns you built can create a sort of rut that prevents you from springing to a new place where the solution might be found. Incidentally, the German word Einstellung means mindset. Basically you can remember einstellung as installing a roadblock because of the way you were initially looking at something. This kind of wrong approach is especially easy to do in sports and science, not to mention other disciplines, **because sometimes your initial intuition about what's happening or what you need to be doing is misleading. You have to unlearn your erroneous older ideas or approaches even while you're learning new ones.**

这一切还与一个叫做“`思维定势`”（Einstellung）的概念相关。在这一现象中，**你最初的简单想法、你已经掌握的概念或神经模式可能会阻碍更好的想法或解决方案的产生**。我们在聚焦弹球的图示中看到，初始的思维弹球上升到大脑的上部，而解决方案的思维模式则在下部。聚焦模式的拥挤和你之前建立的模式可能会造成一种障碍，阻止你跳到一个可能找到解决方案的新地方。顺便提一下，德语中的“Einstellung”意为心态。你可以把“`思维定势`”记作因为最初的视角而设置的路障。这种错误的方法在体育和科学领域尤其容易发生，更不用说其他学科，**因为有时你对正在发生的事情或需要做的事情的初步直觉可能是误导性的。你必须在学习新知识的同时，忘掉错误的旧观念或方法**。

**One significant mistake students sometimes make in learning is jumping into the water before they learn to swim.** In other words, they blindly start working on homework without reading the textbook, attending lectures, viewing online lessons, or even speaking with someone knowledgeable. This is a recipe for sinking. It's like randomly allowing a thought to, kind of pop off in the focus mode pinball machine, without paying any real attention to where the solution truly lies. **Understanding how to obtain real solutions is important in learning and in life.** Mastering a new subject means learning not only the basic chunks, but also learning how to select and use different chunks. **The best way to learn that is by practicing jumping back and forth between problems or situations that require different techniques or strategies**. This is called `interleaving`.

学生在学习中**有一个显著的错误就是在学会游泳之前就跳入水中**。换句话说，他们盲目开始做作业，而不去阅读教科书、参加讲座、观看在线课程，甚至与知识渊博的人交谈。这让学习“翻车”。就像在聚焦模式的弹球机中，随机让一个想法冒出来，而没有真正关注解决方案到底在哪里。**了解如何获得真正的解决方案在学习和生活中都很重要。**掌握一门新学科意味着不仅要学习基本的信息块，还要学习如何选择和使用不同的信息块。学习这一点的最佳方法是**练习在需要不同技巧或策略的问题或情境之间来回跳转**。这被称为`交错学习（interleaving）`。

**Once you have the basic idea of the technique down during your study session**, sort of like learning to ride a bike with training wheels, **start `interleaving` your practice with problems of different types or different types of approaches, concepts, procedures**. Sometimes this can be a little tough to do. A given section in a book, for example, is often devoted to a specific technique, so when you flip to that section you already know which technique you're going to be using. Still, do what you can to mix up your learning. *In science and math in particular it can help to look ahead at the more varied problem sets that are sometimes found at the end of chapters. Or you can deliberately try to make yourself occasionally pick out why some problems call for one technique as opposed to another.* **You want your brain to become used to the idea that just knowing how to use a particular concept, approach, or problemsolving technique isn't enough. You also need to know when to use it.**

**一旦在学习过程中掌握了某种技巧的基本概念**，就像带辅助轮学骑自行车一样，可以**开始将练习与不同类型的问题、方法、概念或步骤混合起来**。这种`交错学习`（interleaving）有助于**深化理解和灵活应用**，但有时可能会有些困难。例如，书中的某一章节通常专注于特定技巧，当翻到该章节时，你已经知道将使用哪种技巧。然而，尽量通过不同方式混合你的学习内容。尤其是在科学和数学领域，这种方法非常有效。*可以尝试提前查看章节末尾的综合问题集，这些问题往往更加多样化。此外，也可以有意识地分析并找出为什么某些问题适合使用一种特定技巧，而不是另一种。***目标是让大脑习惯于不仅仅知道如何使用某种概念、方法或解题技巧，还要知道何时以及为什么使用它。**

`Interleaving` your studies, making it a point to review for a test, for example, by skipping around through problems in the different chapters and materials can sometimes seem to make your learning a little more difficult, but in reality, it helps you learn more deeply. **Interleaving is extraordinarily important. Although practice and repetition is important in helping build solid neural patterns to draw on, it's interleaving that starts building `flexibility` and `creativity`.** *It's where you leave the world of practice and repetition, and begin thinking more independently. When you interleave within one subject or one discipline, you begin to develop your creative power within that discipline. When you interleave between several subjects or disciplines, you can more e asily make interesting new connections between chunks in the different fields, which can enhance your creativity even further.*

`交错学习`，即例如通过在不同章节和材料中跳过问题来复习以备考试，*有时可能让你的学习看起来更困难*，但实际上，它帮助你更深入地学习。**交错学习是极其重要的。虽然练习和重复在帮助建立坚实的神经模式以供调用方面很重要，但正是交错学习开始建立`灵活性`和`创造力`**。*它是你离开练习和重复的世界，开始更独立思考的地方。当你在一个学科或领域内进行交错学习时，你开始在该领域内发展你的创造力。当你在多个学科之间交错学习时，你可以更容易地在不同领域的信息块之间建立有趣的新连接，这可以进一步增强你的创造力。*

Of course it takes time to develop solid chunks of knowledge in different fields, so sometimes there's a **tradeoff**. *Developing expertise in several fields means you can bring very new ideas from one field to the other, but it can also mean that your expertise in one field or the other isn't quite as deep as that of the person who specializes in only one discipline*. On the other hand, **if you develop expertise in only one discipline, you may know it very deeply but you may become more deeply entrenched in your familiar way of thinking and not be able to handle new ideas**. *Philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn discovered that most paradigm shifts in science are brought about either young people or people who were originally trained in a different discipline. **They're not so easily trapped by einstellung, blocked thoughts due to their preceding training**. And of course there's the old saying that science progresses one funeral at a time as people entrenched in the old ways of looking at things die off.*

当然，在不同领域发展扎实的信息块需要时间，因此有时会有**取舍**。*在多个领域发展专业知识意味着你可以将一个领域的新观念带到另一个领域，但这也可能意味着你在某个领域的专业知识不如专注于一个学科的人那么深*。另一方面，**如果你只在一个学科中发展专业知识，虽然你可能了解得非常深入，但你可能会在熟悉的思维方式中更深地陷入，而无法处理新观念**。*科学哲学家托马斯·库恩发现，大多数科学范式转变要么是由年轻人推动，要么是那些最初在不同学科接受过训练的人推动。**他们不那么容易被“设定”束缚，即由于先前的训练而产生的思维障碍**。当然，还有一句老话：科学进步是一场葬礼接着一场葬礼，因为执迷于旧观念的人慢慢去世。*

Finally, don't make the mistake of thinking that learning only occurs in the kinds of subjects you acquire from teachers or books. When you teach a child how to deal effectively with a bully, or you fix a leaky faucet, or you quickly pack a small suitcase for a business trip to Hong Kong, all of these illustrate the outcomes of important aspects of learning. Physicist Richard Feynman was inspired in his Nobel Prize-winning work by watching someone throw a dinner plate into the air in a cafeteria. Mike Rowe of the television shows Dirty Jobs and Somebody's Gotta Do It shows how important and exciting learning can be in a variety of different, non-academic disciplines. I'm Barbara Oakley. Thanks for learning about learning.

最后，**不要误认为学习仅发生在你从老师或书本中获取的学科中**。*当你教孩子如何有效对付霸凌者，或修理漏水的水龙头，或快速为香港的商务旅行打包小行李时，这些都展示了学习的重要方面和成果。物理学家理查德·费曼在获得诺贝尔奖的工作中受到了在自助餐厅看到有人把晚餐盘扔向空中的启发*。电视节目《肮脏工作》和《总得有人做》中的迈克·罗所展示的多种不同非学术学科中的学习，体现了学习的重要性和激动人心的性质。我是芭芭拉·奥克利，感谢你关注学习的艺术。

### 2.9 Summary Week 2

In this video, I'm going to synthesize some of the main ideas of this week's videos. In other words, we'll chunk our week on chunking. Here we go:

在这个视频中，我将总结本周视频的主要思想。换句话说，我们将对本周关于信息块的内容进行概括。下面开始：

Chunks are pieces of information, neuroscientifically speaking, that are bound together through use and often through meaning. You can think of a chunk as a scintillating network of neurons that compactly synthesizes key ideas or actions.

**信息块是神经科学上讲的那些通过使用和意义紧密结合在一起的信息片段**。你可以将信息块视为一个闪烁的神经网络，它紧凑地综合了关键概念或行动。

Chunks can get bigger and more complex. But at the same time, they're a single **easy to access** item that you can fit like a ribbon into the slot on your working memory.

信息块可以变得更大更复杂，但同时它们又是一个**易于访问**的单一项，可以像丝带一样放入你的工作记忆中。

*Chunks are best built with focused, undivided attention, understanding of the **basic idea**, and **practice** to help deepen your patterns and to help you gain **big picture** context.*

*构建信息块的最佳方式是专注于、全神贯注于**基本概念**，并通过**实践**加深你的模式，以帮助你获得**全局视角**。*

`Simple recall`, trying to remember the key points without looking at the page, is one of the best ways to help the chunking process along. It seems to help build neural hooks. They help you better understand the material. Also try recalling material in places that are different from where you originally learned the material, so it becomes more deeply ingrained and accessible, regardless of what room you're in. This can be very helpful for tests.

`简单的回忆`，即试图在不看页面的情况下记住关键点，是促进信息块化过程的最佳方法之一。这似乎有助于建立神经钩子，帮助你更好地理解材料。此外，尝试在不同于最初学习材料的地方回忆内容，这样可以使信息更深入地扎根并更易于获取，无论你身处哪个房间。这对于考试非常有帮助。

`Transfer` is the idea that a chunk you've mastered in one area can often help you much more easily learn chunks of information in different areas that can share surprising commonalities.

`迁移`是指你在一个领域掌握的信息块，往往可以帮助你更轻松地学习不同领域中可能有惊人共性的知识块。

`Interleave` your learning by practicing your choice of different concepts, approach, and techniques all in one session. Chunks are very important, but they don't necessarily build flexibility, which is also important in becoming an expert with the material you're learning.

通过在一个学习会话中练习不同的概念、方法和技术来`交错学习`。信息块非常重要，但它们不一定能建立灵活性，而灵活性在成为所学材料的专家中同样重要。

`Illusions of competence` in learning – learn to recognize when you're fooling yourself about whether you're actually learning the material. Test yourself frequently. Using little minitests to see whether you're actually learning the material, or whether you've been fooling yourself, thinking you're learning when you're actually not. Recall is actually a form of minitesting. Try to avoid depending too much on highlighting, which can fool you into thinking that the material is going into your brain when it actually isn't.

在学习中产生的`能力错觉`——学会识别何时在自欺欺人，认为自己实际上在学习材料。要经常测试自己。使用小型测试来检查自己是否真的在学习材料，还是在自欺欺人，认为自己在学习但实际上并没有。回忆实际上是一种小测试。尽量避免过于依赖标记，这可能会让你误以为材料正在进入你的大脑，而实际上并不是。

**Mistakes are a good thing to make when you're learning. They allow you to catch illusions of competence**. Avoid practicing only the easy stuff, which can bring the illusion that you've mastered the material.

**错误在学习中是好事。它们让你发现能力错觉**。避免只练习简单的内容，这会让你产生掌握材料的错觉。

`Deliberately practice` what you find more difficult to gain full mastery of the material.

`刻意练习`你觉得更难的内容，以全面掌握材料。

`Einstellung` is when your initial thought, an idea you've already had in mind, or a neural pattern you've already developed well and strengthened, prevents a better idea or solution from being found. Or keeps you from being flexible enough to accept new, better, or more appropriate solutions.

`刻板观念`是指你最初的想法、已经在脑海中存在的观念，或者已经发展并强化的神经模式，阻止你发现更好的想法或解决方案，或者让你无法灵活地接受新的、更好的或更合适的解决方案。

`The Law of Serendipity` is helpful – **Lady Luck favors the one who tries**. Just pick one tiny thing out to learn, then another. Just keep trying and you'll be pleasantly surprised at the results. I'm Barbara Oakley. Thanks for learning about learning.

`机缘法则`很有帮助——**幸运女神偏爱那些尝试的人**。只需选择一个小的学习内容，然后再选一个。继续尝试，你会对结果感到惊喜。我是Barbara Oakley。感谢你学习关于学习的内容。

### 2.10 Interview with Dr. Norman Fortenberry - Learning at MIT

### 2.11 Interview with Scott Young, a "Marco Polo" of Learning

### 2.12 Interview with author, Amy Alkon

### 3.1 Introduction to Procrastination and Memory

This week we're going to be talking about two seemingly different ideas. `Procrastination` and `memory`. But the two topics are intimately related. Why? Because building solid chunks of long term memory, chunks that are easily accessible by your short term memory, takes time. It's not the kind of thing you want to be putting off until the last minute. You already have one good tool for procrastination. `The pomodoro`. That powerful 25 minute concentrated period of energized focus. This week we're going to fill you in with more information about how procrastination happens and simple ways to tackle it. And this is key. Ways that don't take much will power, then we'll move on to talking about some of the best ways to access your brain's most powerful long-term memory systems. I'm Barbara Oakley. Thanks for learning how to learn.

本周我们将讨论两个看似不同的主题：`拖延症`和`记忆`。但这两个主题是密切相关的。为什么呢？因为构建牢固的长期记忆块——这些记忆块可以通过你的短期记忆轻松访问——需要时间。这不是你想要留到最后一刻去做的事情。你已经有了一个有效的对抗拖延的工具：`番茄工作法`。这个强大的25分钟集中精力的工作时间段。这个星期，我们将为你提供更多关于拖延如何发生以及简单应对方法的信息。而这些方法是关键——不需要太多意志力。然后我们将讨论一些访问你大脑最强大长期记忆系统的最佳方法。我是Barbara Oakley。感谢你学习如何学习。

### 3.2 Tackling Procrastination: It’s easier and more valuable than you think

Arsenic is incredibly toxic. For centuries until modern methods of detection were discovered, murderers found it to be a very popular substance. So you can imagine the shock at the 48th meeting of the German Association of Arts and Sciences in 1875 when two men sat in the front of the audience and downed more than double a deadly dose of arsenic. The next day the men were back at the conference smiling and healthy. How is it possible to take something so bad for you and stay alive, and even look healthy, despite the damage being done at a microscopic level to your body? The answer has an uncanny relationship to procrastination that's what we're going to be talking about in the next few videos. 

砷是极其有毒的。几个世纪以来，直到现代检测方法被发明，谋杀者们发现它是一种非常受欢迎的物质。因此，想象一下在1875年德国艺术与科学协会第48次会议上，当两位男士在观众面前喝下超过致命剂量两倍的砷时，人们的震惊。第二天，这两位男士满脸笑容，身体健康。这到底是怎么可能的呢？摄入如此有害的物质，竟然还能活着，甚至看起来很健康，尽管你的身体在微观层面上正在受到损害。答案与拖延有着惊人的关联，这正是我们接下来几段视频要讨论的内容。

You've already learned one handy tool to help you with procrastination, the Pomodoro, that 25 minute period of uninterrupted focus followed by a bit of relaxation. This week we're going to learn more. Understanding a little about the cognitive psychology of procrastination, just like understanding the chemistry of poison, can help us develop healthy preventatives. In these videos, I'm going to teach you `the lazy person's approach to tackling procrastination`. **This means you'll be learning about your inner zombies – the routine, habitual responses your brain falls into as a result of specific cues. These `zombie responses` are often focused on making the here and now better. As you'll see you can trick some of these zombies into helping you fend off procrastination when you need to.** Not all procrastination is bad. Even if you're pretty good already in handling procrastination you'll learn some helpful insights here that can allow you to better prioritize your learning.

你已经学会了一个有用的工具来帮助应对拖延——番茄工作法，即25分钟的集中专注时间，之后是一些放松。这个星期我们将学习更多关于拖延的认知心理学知识，就像了解毒药的化学成分一样，能够帮助我们制定健康的预防措施。在这些视频中，我将教你`懒人的拖延应对策略`，这意味着你**将学习内心的“僵尸”——大脑因特定提示而陷入的常规、习惯性反应。这些`僵尸反应`往往专注于让眼前的体验更好。正如你将看到的，你可以欺骗一些这些僵尸，帮助你抵御拖延。**当你需要时，拖延并不总是坏事。即使你已经很擅长处理拖延，这里你也将学到一些有用的见解，让你能够更好地优先安排学习。

The reason that learning to avoid procrastination is so important is that good learning is a bit by bit activity. You want to **avoid cramming which doesn't build solid neural structures**. By putting the same amount of time into your learning but **spacing that learning out by starting earlier you'll learn better**. First things first. Unlike procrastination which is easy to fall into, **willpower is hard to come by. It uses a lot of neural resources**. You shouldn't waste willpower on fending off procrastination except when absolutely necessary. Best of all as you'll see you don't need to.

学习避免拖延的重要性在于，良好的学习是一个逐步进行的过程。你想要**避免死记硬背，因为这并不能建立牢固的神经结构**。如果你**将相同的学习时间分散开来，提前开始学习，你会学得更好**。首先，与容易陷入拖延不同，**自制力是很难获得的，它需要大量的神经资源**。你不应该在抵御拖延时浪费自制力，除非绝对必要。最棒的是，正如你将看到的，你并不需要这样做。

If you'll remember **we procrastinate about things that make us a little bit uncomfortable**. You think about something you don't particularly like and the pain centers of your brain light up so you shift and narrow your focus of attention to something more enjoyable. This causes you to feel better. At least temporarily but sadly the long term effects of habitual avoidance can be nasty. When you put off your studies it can become even more painful to think about studying it. You can choke on tests because you haven't laid the firm neural foundations you need to feel comfortable with the material. Procrastination can be a single monumentally important keystone bad habit, a habit in other words that influences many important areas of your life. If you improve your abilities in this area many other positive changes will gradually begin to unfold.

如果你还记得，**我们拖延的是那些让我们感到不舒服的事情**。当你想到一些不太喜欢的事情时，大脑的痛苦中心会被激活，因此你会将注意力转向更愉快的事情。这样短期内你会感到好一些，但可悲的是，习惯性回避的长期效果可能很糟糕。当你推迟学习时，思考学习的过程会变得更加痛苦。你可能在考试中表现不佳，因为你没有打下扎实的神经基础，无法对材料感到舒适。拖延可能是一个非常重要的基石坏习惯，也就是说，它影响着你生活中的许多重要领域。如果你能在这一领域提高能力，许多积极的变化将会逐渐展开。

Procrastination shares features with addiction. It offers temporary excitement and relief from sometimes boring reality. It's easy to fool yourself for example into thinking that the best use of any given moment is. Surfing the web for information instead of actually reading the textbook or doing the assigned problems. You start to tell yourself stories. For example you might tell yourself that organic chemistry requires special reasoning, your weakness, so of course you're doing very poorly at it. You devise irrational excuses that sound superficially reasonable like if I study too far ahead of the test I'll forget the material. If you're troubled by procrastination you may even start telling yourself that procrastination is an innate unchangeable characteristic. After all if procrastination were easily fixable wouldn't you have fixed it by now?

**拖延与成瘾有一些相似之处。它提供了暂时的兴奋感和对有时无聊现实的解脱**。*你很容易自欺欺人，认为在任何时刻，冲浪网页获取信息比实际阅读教科书或完成作业更有价值。你开始**编造故事**。例如，你可能告诉自己，有机化学**需要特殊的推理能力**，而这是你的弱项，因此你当然做得很糟糕。你会想出听起来很合理的不理性借口，比如“如果我提前学习考试的内容，我会忘记”。如果你被拖延困扰，甚至可能开始告诉自己，拖延是一个与生俱来的、不可改变的特征。*毕竟，如果拖延是容易解决的问题，你早就解决了。

The higher you go in your studies however the more important it is to take control of procrastination. **Habits that worked in earlier years can turn around and bite you.** What I'll show you in these next few videos is how you can become the master of your habit. You should be making the decisions, not your well-meaning but unthinking zombies, your habits. As you'll see, the strategies for dealing with procrastination are simple. It's just that sometimes they aren't intuitively obvious.

然而，随着学习的深入，控制拖延变得愈发重要。**以前有效的习惯可能会反噬你。**在接下来的视频中，我将展示如何掌握你的习惯。你应该做出决策，而不是由那些善意但无意识的僵尸（习惯）来决定。正如你将看到的，处理拖延的策略其实很简单，只是有时并不直观。

So let's return to that story that began this video. The arsenic eaters started with tiny doses of arsenic. In tiny doses, arsenic doesn't seem harmful. You can even build up an immunity to its effects. This can allow you to take larger doses and look healthy, even as the poison is slowly increasing your risk of cancer and ravaging your organs. In a similar way procrastinators put off just that one little thing. They do it again and again gradually growing used to it. They can even look healthy but the long term effects? Not so good. I'm Barbara Oakley. Thanks for learning how to learn.

回到视频开始的那个故事，吃砷者开始时只摄入微量砷。在微量摄入的情况下，砷似乎并无害处。你甚至可以对其影响产生免疫力。这可能使你能够摄入更大剂量，依然看起来健康，尽管毒素却在慢慢增加你罹患癌症的风险，并破坏你的器官。类似地，拖延者会推迟那一件小事，一次又一次，逐渐习惯这种状态。他们甚至看起来很健康，但长期效果却不容乐观。我是Barbara Oakley，感谢你学习如何学习。

### 3.3 Zombies Everywhere

Just imagine backing out of a driveway for the first time ever in your life. *For some of you, that might seem like a pretty exciting proposition. The first time you might do this you would be in hyper alert. The deluge of information coming at you would make the job seem almost impossibly difficult. But, once you've chunked how to back up down your driveway, all you have to do is think, let's go. And, off you go.* **Your brain goes into this sort of zombie mode, where it is only semi aware of a few key factors, instead of being overwhelmed by all the data.** It's the same idea with riding a bicycle. At first, it's really hard, later it's easy. Neuro-scientifically speaking, chunking is related to habit. Habit is an energy saver for us. **It allows us to free our mind for other types of activities.**

想象一下，第一次从车道上倒车。对你们中的一些人来说，这可能是一个相当激动人心的提议。*第一次倒车时，你会非常警觉。接踵而来的信息量会让这件事显得几乎不可能完成。但一旦你掌握了如何倒车的技巧，你只需想着“走吧”，然后就出发了。***你的大脑进入了一种半意识的“僵尸模式”，只关注几个关键因素，而不再被所有数据淹没。**这种情况和骑自行车一样，最初很困难，后来就容易了。从神经科学的角度来看，分块（chunking）与习惯有关。**习惯为我们节省能量，使我们能够将注意力释放到其他活动上**。

*You go into this habitual zombie mode far more often than you might think.* **That's the point of habit, you don't have to think in a focused manner about what you’re doing while you're performing the habit.** It saves energy. Habits can be good and bad. They can be brief, like absently brushing back your hair. Or they can be long, for example when you take a walk, or watch television for a few hours after you get home from work. 

*你进入这种习惯性的“僵尸模式”的频率比你想象的要高*。**这就是习惯的意义：在执行习惯时，你无需集中思考**。习惯可以是好也可以是坏。它们可以很短，比如无意识地理顺头发；也可以很长，比如下班后散步或看几个小时的电视。

You can think of habits as having four parts. The first is the `cue`. This is the trigger that launches you into zombie mode. The cue may be something as simple as seeing the first item in your to do list. Time to start next week's homework. Or seeing a text message from a friend. Time to stop work. A cue by itself is, neither helpful nor harmful; it's the routine. What we do in reaction to that cue, that's what matters. Number two – the `routine`. This is your `zombie mode`. The routine habitual response your brain is used to falling into when it receives the cue. Zombie responses can be useful, harmless, or sometimes harmful. Number three, the `reward`. Every habit develops and continues because it rewards us. It gives us an immediate little feeling of pleasure. *Procrastination's an easy habit to develop because the reward, moving your mind's focus to something more pleasant, happens so quickly and easily.* But good habits can also be rewarded. Finding ways to reward good study habits is important for escaping procrastination. Number four – the `belief`. Habits have power because of your belief in them. For example, you might feel you'll never be able to change your habits of putting off your studies until late in the day. To change a habit, you'll need to change your underlying belief. I'm Barbara Oakley, thanks for learning how to learn.

你可以将习惯分为四个部分。第一是`提示`。这是启动你进入僵尸模式的触发器。提示可能是看到待办事项列表中的第一项，意味着是时候开始下周的作业；或是看到朋友发来的短信，意味着是时候停下工作。仅仅一个提示本身并没有好坏之分，关键在于反应。第二是`常规`。这是你的`僵尸模式`。习惯性的反应是你的大脑在接收到提示时习惯性地进入的状态。僵尸反应可以是有用的、无害的，或者有时是有害的。第三是`奖励`。每一个习惯的形成和持续都因为它给我们带来了奖励。它会带来一种立即的愉悦感。*拖延是一个容易形成的习惯，因为将注意力转移到更愉快的事情上会迅速而轻松地得到奖励。*但好的习惯同样可以得到奖励。找到奖励良好学习习惯的方法，对于摆脱拖延至关重要。第四是`信念`。习惯的力量来源于你对它们的信念。例如，你可能会觉得自己永远无法改变拖延学习的习惯。要改变一个习惯，你需要改变其背后的信念。我是Barbara Oakley，感谢你学习如何学习。


### 3.4 Surf’s Up: Process versus Product

One of the best ways of being effective in your learning is to use mental tools and tricks to inspire and motivate yourself. First, when it comes to learning in general, you should realize that it's perfectly normal to start with a few negative feelings about beginning a learning session. Even when it's a subject you ordinary like, it's how you handle those feelings that matters. Researchers have found that non-procrastinators put their negative thinking aside saying things to themselves like: quit wasting time and just get on with it, once you get going, you'll feel better about it.

提高学习效率的最佳方法之一是使用心理工具和技巧来激励自己。首先，关于学习，*您应该意识到在开始学习时产生一些负面情绪是完全正常的。即使是您通常喜欢的科目*，**处理这些情绪的方式才是关键**。研究发现，不拖延的人会**将负面思维搁置一旁**，告诉自己：**“别浪费时间，开始吧；一旦开始，你就会感觉好些。”**

If you find yourself avoiding certain tasks because they make you feel uncomfortable, you should know there's another helpful way to re-frame things. And that's **to learn to focus on process not product**. *Process means, the flow of time and the habits and actions associated with that flow of time. As in, I'm going to spend 20 minutes working. Product is an outcome, for example, a homework assignment that you need to finish.* 

如果您发现自己因为某些任务让自己感到不适而避免去做，您应该知道还有一种有帮助的方法可以重新框架，那就是**专注于过程而非结果**。*过程意味着时间的流动以及与时间流动相关的习惯和行为，例如：“我将花20分钟进行学习。”而结果则是一个具体的成果，比如您需要完成的作业。*

To prevent procrastination you want **to avoid concentrating on product**. Instead, your attention should be **on building processes**. **Processes relate to simple habits**, *habits that coincidentally allow you to do the unpleasant tasks that need to be done*. For example, let’s say you don't like doing homework in a particular class. So you put off working on the homework. It's only five questions you think. How hard could that be? Deep down, you realize that answering these five questions could be a very lengthy job. *It's easier to live in a fantasy world where the five questions, or the ten page report or whatever, can be done at the last minute.* 

为了防止拖延，您要**避免过于关注结果**。相反，您的**注意力应放在建立过程上**。**过程与简单的习惯相关**，*这些习惯恰好能帮助您完成那些需要做的不愉快的任务*。例如，假设您不喜欢在某一门课上做作业，于是您把作业推迟。您心里想：“这只是五个问题，难道很难吗？”但实际上，您深知回答这五个问题可能需要花费相当长的时间。*生活在幻想中更容易，以为这五个问题或十页的报告可以在最后时刻完成。*

Your challenge is to avoid focusing on the product, the answers to the questions. *The product is what triggers the pain that causes you to procrastinate*. Instead, you need to focus on the process or processes – the small chunks of time you need over days or even weeks to answer the questions or prepare for tests. Who cares whether you finish the homework or grasp the key concepts in any one session. The whole point instead, is that *you calmly put forth your best effort for a short period*. 

您的挑战是避免关注结果，即问题的答案。*结果会引发痛苦，从而导致拖延*。相反，您需要专注于过程——在几天甚至几周内回答问题或准备考试所需的小段时间。谁在乎您是否在某一节课上完成了作业或掌握了关键概念。关键在于，您*冷静地在短时间内尽最大努力*。

Now process. Notice how in this picture physicist and surfer Garret Lacy is focused on the moment. Not on the accomplishment of having surfed that wave. For you, *one of the easiest ways to focus on process is to focus on doing a Pomodoro*, a 25 minute timed work session, not on completing a task. The essential idea here is that **the zombie habitual part of your brain likes processes because it can march mindlessly along**. It's far easier to enlist the friendly zombie habit to help with a process, than to help with a product. 

注意在这张图片中，物理学家和冲浪者 Garret Lacy 专注于当下，而不是已经冲浪成功的成就。对您来说，*专注于过程的一个简单方法是进行番茄工作法*，即25分钟的定时学习，而不是完成某个任务。这里的核心思想是，**大脑的习惯性部分喜欢过程，因为它可以无意识地进行**。让友好的僵尸习惯帮助完成一个过程，要比帮助完成一个结果容易得多。

By focusing on process rather than product, you **allow yourself to back away from judging yourself**, am I getting closer to finishing? And instead you allow yourself to relax into the flow of the work. The key is **when a distraction arises, which it inevitably will, you want to train yourself to just let it flow by**. Of course, setting yourself up so that distractions are minimal is also a very good idea. Many students find that either a quiet space or noise canceling headphones if, if you can afford them, can be helpful when they're really trying to concentrate. 

通过专注于过程而非结果，您可以**避免自我评判**：“我离完成还有多远？”而是让自己放松，融入工作之中。关键是，**当分心出现时（这是不可避免的），您要训练自己让它自然流过**。当然，设置一个干扰最小的环境也是非常好的主意。许多学生发现，在真正需要集中注意力时，安静的空间或降噪耳机（如果可以负担得起的话）是很有帮助的。

### 3.5 Harnessing Your Zombies to Help You

> [ˈhɑːrnɪs] v. 控制并利用；（把动物）拴在一起（或拴到某物上）；给（马）套上挽具；连接，串联 n. （马的）挽具，马具；系带，吊带；日常工作

In this video, we're going to get into the specifics of harnessing your zombie powers of habit to help you avoid procrastination while *minimizing your use of willpower*. You don't want to do a full scale change of old habits. You just want to override parts of them and develop a few new ones. The trick to overriding a habit is to look to change your reaction to a cue. The only place you need to apply willpower is to change your reaction to the cue. To understand that, it helps to go back through the four components of habit and re-analyze them from the perspective of procrastination. 

在这个视频中，我们将具体探讨如何利用习惯的“僵尸力量”来帮助您避免拖延，同时*尽量减少对意志力的使用*。您不需要彻底改变旧习惯，只需覆盖部分习惯并发展一些新习惯。覆盖习惯的关键是改变您对提示的反应。您只需在提示出现时运用意志力来改变反应。为了理解这一点，回顾习惯的四个组成部分，并从拖延的角度重新分析它们是很有帮助的。

The first one is `the cue`. Recognize what launches you into your zombie procrastination mode. **Cues usually fall into one of the four following categories: 1. Location 2. Time 3. How you feel, and 4. Reactions either to other people or to something that just happened.** Do you look something up on the web and then find yourself web surfing? Does a text message disturb your studying taking you 10 minutes to get back into the flow of things even when you try to keep yourself on task? *The issue with procrastination is that because it's an automatic habit, you're often unaware that you've begun to procrastinate. You can prevent the most damaging cues by shutting off your cell phone or keeping yourself away from the internet and other distractions for brief periods of time, as when you're doing a pomodoro.*

第一个是`提示`。识别是什么促使您进入拖延的“僵尸模式”。**提示通常分为以下四类：1. 地点 2. 时间 3. 您的情绪 4. 对他人或某事发生的反应。**您是否在网上查找某些东西后开始随意浏览网页？短信打扰了您的学习，让您花费十分钟才重新进入状态，即使您努力保持专注。*拖延的问题在于，由于它是自动习惯，您常常没有意识到自己已经开始拖延。您可以通过关掉手机或在进行番茄工作法时短时间远离互联网和其他干扰来防止最具破坏性的提示。*

Number two, `the routine`. Let's say then instead of doing your studies you often divert your attention to something less painful. Your brain wants to automatically go into this routine when you've gotten your cue. So **this, is the reaction clue where you must actively focus on re-wiring your old habit**. The key to re-wiring is to **have a plan**. **Developing a new ritual** can be helpful. *Some students make it a habit to leave their phone in their car when they head in for class which removes a potent distraction. Many students discovered the value of settling into a quiet spot in the library or closer to home, the productive effects of simply sitting in a favorite chair at the proper time with all Internet access disconnected*. **Your plan may not work perfectly at first, but just keep at it.** Adjust the plan if necessary, and savor those victories when your plan works. **Don't try to change everything at once**. The Pomodoro technique can be especially helpful in shifting your reaction to the cues.

第二，`例行公事`。假设您经常在学习时分散注意力，转而做一些更轻松的事情。您的大脑在得到提示时会自动进入这个例行公事。因此，这是您必须**主动集中精力重新连接旧习惯的反应提示**。重新连接的关键是**制定计划**。**建立新的仪式**可能会有所帮助。*有些学生养成将手机留在车里的习惯，这样就去除了强烈的干扰。许多学生发现，在图书馆或家附近的安静地方坐下，或者在适当的时间坐在自己喜欢的椅子上、断开互联网连接，可以产生很好的效果*。**您的计划可能一开始并不完美，但请继续努力**。如果有必要，请调整计划，并在计划有效时享受那些小胜利。**不要试图一次性改变所有事情**。番茄工作法在改变对提示的反应时尤其有效。

Number three is the `reward`. This can sometimes require a little bit of investigation. Why are you procrastinating? Can you substitute an emotional payoff, maybe a feeling of pride for accomplishing something, even if it's small, a sense of satisfaction? Can you win a small internal bet or a contest about something you've turned into a personal game or allow yourself to indulge in a latte or read a favorite web site, provide yourself, maybe, with an evening of mindless television or web surfing without guilt, and will you give yourself a bigger reward for a bigger achievement? Maybe movie tickets or a sweater or an utterly frivolous purchase. Remember that **habits are powerful because they create neurological cravings**. It helps to add a new reward if you want to overcome your previous cravings. Only once your brain starts expecting that reward will the important rewiring take place that will allow you to create new habits. Many people find that *setting a reward at a specific time, for example, breaking for lunch with a friend at the deli at noon or stopping the main task at 5 p.m., gives a solid, `mini deadline` that can help spur work*. Don't feel bad if you find you have trouble getting into a flow state at first. I sometimes find it takes a few days of drudgery, through a few cycles of the Pomodoro technique before flow begins to unfold. And I find myself starting to enjoy work on a new topic. Also remember that *the better you get at something, the more enjoyable it can become*. 

第三，`奖励`。这有时需要一些调查。您为什么会拖延？您是否可以替代情感上的满足感，比如完成某件事情带来的自豪感，即使它很小？您可以制定一个小的内部赌注或比赛，把某件事变成个人游戏，或者允许自己享受一杯拿铁，或阅读一个喜欢的网站，给自己一个无愧的晚上，随意看电视或上网，或者在取得更大成就时给予自己更大的奖励，比如电影票、一件毛衣或一个完全无用的购买。记住，**习惯之所以强大，是因为它们会产生神经渴望**。如果您想克服之前的渴望，增加新的奖励会有所帮助。只有当您的大脑开始期待该奖励时，重要的重新连接才会发生，使您能够创造新的习惯。许多人发现，*在特定时间设定奖励，比如中午与朋友在熟食店吃午餐，或下午5点停止主要任务，提供一个坚实的`小截止日期`，有助于激励工作*。如果您发现自己一开始很难进入状态，不要感到沮丧。我发现，有时需要几天的枯燥，经历几轮番茄工作法，才能开始享受新主题的工作。此外，记住，*您在某件事情上越熟练，它就变的越有趣。*

Number four is the `belief`. The most important part of **changing your procrastination habit is the belief that you can do it**. You may find that when the going gets stressful. You long to fall back into old, more comfortable habits. Belief that your new system works is what can get you through. Part of what can underpin is to develop a new community. Hang out with classmates, or virtually hang out with MOOC-mates, who may have that can-do philosophy that you too want to develop. Developing and encouraging culture with like-minded friends can help us remember the values that in moments of weakness we tend to forget. 

第四，`信念`。改变拖延习惯最重要的部分是**相信自己能够做到**。*当压力变大时，您可能会渴望回归旧的、更舒适的习惯。相信您的新系统有效能够让您坚持下去*。部分支撑这种信念的方式是建立一个新的社群。与同学或在线课程的同学一起交流，培养一种积极的思维哲学。与志同道合的朋友建立和鼓励文化，可以帮助我们在脆弱时刻记住我们常常忘记的价值观。

### 3.6 Juggling Life and Learning

Learning for most people involves a `complex balancing` of many different tasks. A good way for you to keep perspective about what you're trying to learn and accomplish, is to *once a week write a brief weekly list of key tasks in a planner journal*. Then each day on another page of your planner journal, write a list of the tasks that you can reasonably work on or accomplish. Try to write this daily task list the evening before. Why the evening before? Research has shown that this helps your subconscious to grapple with the tasks on the list so you can figure out how to accomplish them. Writing the list before you go to sleep, enlists your zombies, to help you accomplish the items on the list the next day. 

对大多数人来说，学习涉及许多不同任务的`复杂平衡`。保持对您所学习和要完成的事情的清晰视角的好方法，是*每周在计划日记中写一个简短的关键任务列表*。然后每天在计划日记的另一页上，写下您可以合理完成的任务列表。*尽量在前一天晚上写下这个日常任务列表*。为什么选择前一天晚上？研究表明，这有助于您的潜意识处理列表上的任务，从而帮助您找到完成这些任务的方法。在睡觉前写下任务，可以调动您的“僵尸习惯”，帮助您在第二天完成列表上的项目。

*If you don't write your tasks down on a list, they lurk at the edge of the four or so slots of your working memory, **taking up valuable mental real estate***. But **once you make a task list, it frees working memory for problem solving**. So let's look at one of my daily task lists. As you can see here, there are only six items. Some are `process oriented`. For example, I have a paper due to a journal in several months. So, I spend a little focus time on most days working towards completing it. A few items are `product oriented`. But that is only because they are doable within a limited period of time. Note my reminders. I wanted to keep my focus on each item when I'm working on it. And I want to have fun. I did catch myself getting side tracked, because I forgot to shut down my email. To get myself back into gear, I set a 22 minute Pomodoro challenge, using a timer on my computer desktop. Why 22 minutes? Well, why not? I, I don't have to do the same thing each time. And notice, too, that by moving to Pomodoro mode, I've switched to a process orientation. 

*如果您不将任务写在列表上，它们就会在工作记忆的边缘徘徊，**占据宝贵的心理空间***。但一旦您**制作了任务列表，它就为解决问题释放了工作记忆**。让我们看看我的一个日常任务列表。如您所见，只有六项任务。其中一些是`过程导向`的。例如，我有一篇论文将在几个月后提交，所以我每天花一点时间朝着完成它的方向努力。还有一些是`产品导向`的，但那是因为它们在有限的时间内可以完成。请注意我的提醒，我希望在工作时专注于每一项任务，并且要有乐趣。我发现自己因为忘了关闭电子邮件而分心。为了重新进入状态，我设置了一个 22 分钟的番茄工作法挑战，使用计算机桌面的计时器。为什么是 22 分钟？因为我可以灵活选择时间。请注意，通过切换到番茄工作法，我已切换到过程导向。

None of the items on my list is **too big**, because I've got other things going on in my day. Meetings to go to, a lecture to give. Sometimes I sprinkle a few tasks that involve physical motion on my list, even if it's just cleaning something. Which, I'll admit, isn't ordinarily one of my favorite things to do. Somehow because I'm using them as diffuse mode breaks, I often look forward to them. Mixing other tasks up with your learning seems to make everything more enjoyable and keeps you from prolonged and unhealthy bouts of sitting. Over time, as I've gained more experience, I've gotten much better at gauging how long it takes to do any given task. You'll find yourself **improving quickly as you become more realistic about what you can reasonably do in any given time**. Make notes in your planner journal about what works and what doesn't. 

列表上的任务**没有一个过于宏大**，因为我还有其他事务要处理，例如会议和讲座。有时，我会在列表中添加一些涉及身体活动的任务，即使只是清理一些东西。老实说，这通常不是我喜欢做的事情。但由于我将它们作为放松的间歇，我常常期待这些任务。将其他任务与学习混合似乎使一切变得更加愉快，并能避免长时间的不健康坐姿。随着时间的推移，随着经验的增加，我对完成任何任务所需时间的判断变得更好。您会发现，**当您对自己在任何给定时间内合理可以完成的事情变得更加现实时，进步会很快**。在您的计划日记中记录哪些有效，哪些无效。

Notice my `goal finish time` for the day, 5 p.m. doesn't seem quite right, does it? But it is right, and it's one of the most important components of your daily planner journal. **Planning your quitting time is as important as planning your working time**. Generally, I aim to quit at 5 p.m., although when I'm learning something new, it can sometimes be a pleasure to look at it again after I've taken an evening break, just before I go to sleep, and occasionally, there's a major project that I'm wrapping up, like say, this MOOC that has me running into a bit of overtime. 

请注意，我的`目标结束时间`是下午5点，似乎并不完全对，但实际上是正确的，这是您日常计划日记中最重要的组成部分之一。**规划结束时间与规划工作时间同样重要**。通常，我的目标是下午 5 点结束工作，尽管当我学习新内容时，休息后在睡觉前再次查看这些内容，有时也是一种乐趣。偶尔，在我完成一项重要项目时，例如这个 MOOC，我会延长一点时间。

You might think, well, yeah, you know, but you're a professor who's shall we say, past your youthful study days. Of course an early quitting time is fine for you. However, one of my most admired study experts, Cal Newport, used the 5 p.m., quitting time through most of his student career. He ended up getting his PhD from MIT. In other words, this method, implausible though it may seem for some, can work for undergraduate and graduate students in rigorous academic programs.

您可能会想，当然，您是一位教授，已经过了年轻的学习时期。早早结束工作对您来说当然没问题。然而，我非常钦佩的一位学习专家 Cal Newport 在他的大部分学生生涯中也采用了下午5点的结束时间。他最终获得了 MIT 的博士学位。换句话说，这种方法，虽然对于一些人来说似乎不太可行，但对于本科生和研究生在严格的学术项目中是有效的。

Time after time, **those who are committed to maintaining healthy leisure time along with their hard work, outperform those who doggedly pursue an endless treadmill**. Of course, your life may not lend itself to such a schedule with breaks and leisure time. You may be running on fumes with two jobs and too many classes. But however your life is going, try to squeeze a little break time in. 

一次又一次，**那些致力于保持健康的休闲时间与辛勤工作相结合的人，往往比那些一味追求无尽工作的人表现更出色**。当然，您的生活可能并不适合这样有间歇和休闲时间的日程安排。您可能在两份工作和太多课程之间精疲力竭。但无论您的生活怎样，都尽量挤出一点休息时间。

One more thing – as writing coach Daphne Graygrant recommends to her writing clients, **eat your frogs first in the morning**. Try to work on a most important and most disliked task first. At least just one Pomodoro, as soon as you wake up. This is incredibly effective. Do you need to sometimes make changes in your plans because of unforeseen events? Of course, but remember the law of serendipity; Lady Luck favors the one who tries. Planning well is part of trying. Keep your eye on your learning goal, and try not to get too unsettled by occasional roadblocks. 

还有一点——正如写作教练 Daphne Graygrant 对她的写作客户所推荐的，**早上先处理最重要和最不喜欢的任务**。尽量在早上醒来后完成至少一个番茄工作法的时间。这是非常有效的。您是否有时需要因不可预见的事件而调整计划？当然，但请记住机缘法则；好运常青睐于那些努力尝试的人。良好的规划是尝试的一部分。始终关注您的学习目标，尽量不要被偶尔的障碍所打扰。

### 3.7 Summing Up Procrastination

**Learning well often involves bit by bit, day by day building of solid neural scaffolds**. Rather like a weight lifter builds muscle with day to day exercise. This is why tackling procrastination is so incredibly important. You want to keep up with your learning and avoid last minute cramming. So with that, here's an overview of the key aspects of tackling procrastination.
  - Keep a planner journal so you can easily track when you reach your goals and observe what does and doesn't work. 
  - Commit yourself to certain routines and tasks each day. Write your planned tasks out the night before so your brain has time to dwell on your goals and help ensure success. 
  - Arrange your work into a series of small challenges. Always make sure you, and your zombies, get lots of rewards. 
  - Take a few minutes to savor the feelings of happiness and triumph, which also gives your brain a chance to temporarily change modes. 
  - Deliberately delay rewards until you've finished a task. Watch for procrastination cues. 
  - Try putting yourself in new surroundings with few procrastination cues, such as the quiet section of a library. 
  - Gain trust in your new system. You want to work hard during times of focused concentration and also to trust your system enough so that when it comes time to relax, you actually relax without feelings of guilt or worry. 
  - Have back up plans for when you still procrastinate. No one’s perfect after all. 
  - Eat your frogs first every day. Happy experimenting.

**有效学习通常需要一点一滴地逐步构建坚实的神经框架**，就像举重者通过日常锻炼来锻炼肌肉一样。这就是为什么应对拖延症如此重要的原因。您想跟上学习进度，避免临时抱佛脚。那么，以下是应对拖延症的关键要素概述：
  - 保持计划日志：方便**跟踪目标达成情况，观察什么有效，什么无效**。
  - **每天承诺某些例行任务**：计划任务时，晚上提前写下，以便大脑有时间思考目标，确保成功。
  - 将工作分解成小挑战：这样可以更容易地应对和完成。
  - 确保奖励自己和“僵尸”：花几分钟享受成功带来的快乐，这也给大脑一个暂时改变模式的机会。
  - 在完成任务后再奖励自己：故意延迟奖励，直到任务完成。
  - 注意拖延的信号：尝试将自己置于新的环境中，比如图书馆的安静区域，减少拖延的诱因。
  - 信任您的新系统：在集中注意力时努力工作，并信任系统，以便放松时真正放松，而不感到内疚或担忧。
  - 制定备选计划：即使在拖延时也要有后备计划。毕竟，没有人是完美的。
  - 每天先处理最困难的任务：先“吃掉青蛙”。

### 3.8 Diving Deeper into Memory

In this video and the next, we're going to deepen our understanding of memory. As you're probably beginning to understand, memory is only part of learning and developing expertise but it's often an important part. It may surprise you to learn that we have outstanding **visual and spatial memory systems** that can help form part of our long-term memory. Here's what I mean. If you were asked to look around a house you never visited before, you'd soon have a sense of the general furniture layout and where the rooms were, color scheme, the pharmaceuticals in the bathroom cupboard. In just a few minutes, your mind would acquire and retain thousands of new pieces of information. Even weeks later, you'd still hold far more in your mind than if you'd spent the same amount of time staring at a blank wall. *Your mind is built to **retain** this kind of **general information** about a place.* You can greatly enhance your ability to remember if you tap into these naturally super-sized, visual, spatial memorization abilities. *Our ancestors never needed a vast memory for names or numbers but they did need a memory for how to get back home from the three day deer hunt, or for the location of those plump blueberries on the rocky slopes to the South of the camp. These evolutionary needs helped lock in a superior "where things are" and "how they look" memory system.*

在这个视频和下一个视频中，我们将加深对记忆的理解。正如你可能已经开始明白的那样，记忆只是学习和发展专业技能的一部分，但它通常是一个重要的部分。你可能会惊讶地发现，我们有着**出色的视觉和空间记忆系统**，可以帮助构建我们长期记忆的一部分。让我来解释一下。*如果你被要求看一看一栋你从未到过的房子，你很快就会对整体家具布局、房间的位置、色调、浴室柜里的药品有一个大致的了解。*在短短几分钟内，你的大脑会获取并保持成千上万条新信息。即使是几周后，你仍然会记住比你花同样时间盯着一面空白墙更多的信息。你的*大脑天生就是用来**保持**关于一个地方的这种**总体信息**的*。如果你能利用这些天生超强的视觉和空间记忆能力，你的记忆力将会大大增强。*我们的祖先从来不需要记住大量的名字或数字，但他们确实需要记住如何从三天的鹿猎中找到回家的路，或者记住那些位于营地南方岩坡上的饱满蓝莓的位置。这些进化上的需求帮助他们建立了一种优越的“事物在哪里”和“它们长什么样”的记忆系统。*

To begin tapping into your visual memory system try making a very memorable visual image representing one key item you want to remember. For example, here's an image you could use to remember Newton's second law, f = ma. This is a fundamental relationship relating force to mass and acceleration (force = mass x acceleration). And it only took humans, oh, a couple of hundred thousand years to figure out. The letter f in the formula could stand for flying, m could stand for mule, and a, well that's up to you. Part of the reason an image is so important to memory is that images connect directly to your right brain's visual spatial centers. The image helps you encapsulate a seemingly humdrum and hard to remember concept by tapping into visual areas with enhanced memory abilities. The more neural hooks you can build by evoking the senses, the easier it will be for you to recall the concept and what it means. Beyond merely seeing the mule, you can smell the mule, you can feel the same windy pressure the mule is feeling.. You can even, hear the wind whistling past. The funnier and more evocative the images, the better. 

为了开始利用你的视觉记忆系统，试着为你想记住的一个关键项目创造一个非常难忘的视觉图像。例如，这里有一个你可以用来记住牛顿第二定律（f = ma）的图像。这是一个基本的关系，描述了力与质量和加速度之间的关系（力 = 质量 × 加速度）。而且，人类花了，嗯，大约几十万年的时间才弄明白这个公式。公式中的字母f可以代表飞翔，m可以代表骡子，而a，嗯，那就由你来决定了。*图像之所以对记忆如此重要，部分原因是因为图像直接与右脑的视觉空间中心连接。*这个图像帮助你通过调动具有增强记忆能力的视觉区域，将一个看似平淡且难以记住的概念呈现出来。你可以通过唤起感官来建立更多的神经连接，这样你就更容易回忆起这个概念及其含义。除了看到那只骡子，你还可以闻到骡子的气味，你可以感觉到骡子正在感受到的风压。你甚至可以听到风呼啸而过。图像越有趣、越引人入胜，它对记忆的帮助就越大。

Focusing your attention brings something into your temporary working memory, but for that something to move from working memory to long term memory two things should happen: the idea should be memorable; there's a gigantic flying mule braying f = ma on my couch, and it must be repeated. Otherwise remember your tiny metabolic vampires, they can suck away the neural pattern related to that memory before it can strengthen and solidify. Repetition is important. Even when you make something memorable, repetition helps get that memorable item firmly lodged into long-term memory. Remember to repeat not a bunch of times in one day but sporadically over several days. Index cards can often be helpful. Writing and saying what you're trying to learn seems to enhance retention. For example, if you're trying to learn concepts in physics you might take an index card and write the greek letter rho (ρ). That's a common abbreviation for density. You'd write it on one side and you'd write the remaining information on the other. Handwriting helps you to more deeply encode, that is convert into neural memory structures what you are trying to learn. While you're writing out the kilograms per cubic meter (kilogram/m3) you might imagine a shadowy kilogram just feel that mass lurking in an oversize piece of baggage that happens to be one meter on each side. The more you can turn what you're trying to remember into something memorable, the easier it will be to recall. You'll want to say the word and its meaning aloud to start setting auditory hooks to the material. Next, just look at the side of the card with the Greek letter rho (ρ) on it, and see whether you can remember what's on the other side of the card. If you can't, flip it over and remind yourself what you're supposed to know. If you can remember, put the card away. Now, do something else. Perhaps prepare another card and test yourself on it. Once you have several cards together, try running through them all and even mixing them around to see if you can remember them. This helps interleave your learning. Don't be surprised if you struggle a bit. Once you've given your cards a good try, put them away. Wait and take them out again, maybe before you go to sleep. Remember that sleep is when your mind repeats patterns and pieces together solutions. Briefly repeat what you want to remember over several days. Perhaps for a few minutes each morning or each evening. Gradually extend the time between the repetitions as the material firms itself into your mind. By increasing your spacing as you become more certain of mastery, you'll lock the material more firmly into place. Great flash card systems like Anki have built in algorithms that repeat in scale ranging from days to months. Interestingly, one of the best ways to remember people's names, is to simply try to retrieve the people's names from memory at increasing time intervals, after first learning the name.

集中注意力将某个事物带入你的短期工作记忆中，但要让这个事物从工作记忆转移到长期记忆中，必须发生两件事：这个想法应该是值得记住的；比如说我沙发上的巨大飞骡子正在大声叫喊着 f = ma，而且它必须重复。否则，记住那些小小的代谢吸血鬼，它们可能会在神经模式尚未强化和巩固之前，将与该记忆相关的模式吸走。重复是非常重要的。即使你已经让某个事物变得值得记住，重复有助于将这个可记住的项目牢牢地固守在长期记忆中。记住，不是一天之内重复很多次，而是要在几天内间歇性地重复。索引卡通常很有帮助。写出并朗读你想学习的内容似乎有助于增强记忆力。例如，如果你在学习物理概念，你可以拿一张索引卡，写下希腊字母 rho (ρ)，它是密度的常见缩写。你可以在一面写下它，另一面写下相关的内容。手写有助于你更深刻地编码，即将你想要学习的内容转化为神经记忆结构。当你写下每立方米千克（千克/立方米）时，你可以想象一个阴影般的千克，感觉到它像一个超大的行李箱一样的质量，而这个行李箱正好是每边一米。你越能把你想记住的东西转化为值得记住的内容，你就越容易回忆起来。你可以大声说出这个词和它的含义，开始为它的听觉记忆建立钩子。接下来，只看卡片上写有希腊字母 rho (ρ) 的一面，看看你是否能记住另一面上的内容。如果记不住，翻过来提醒自己应该记住什么。如果记得住，就把卡片收起来。然后，做些其他事情。也许准备另一张卡片并测试自己。一旦你有了几张卡片，试着把它们全部浏览一遍，甚至把它们混合起来，看看你是否能记住它们。这有助于将你的学习交替进行。不要对自己有所挣扎感到惊讶。一旦你对卡片做了充分的测试，就把它们放起来。等待几天，再拿出来，也许是在睡觉前。记住，睡眠是你大脑重复模式并拼接解决方案的时候。简短地重复你想记住的内容，分散在几天内。也许每天早上或每晚花几分钟。随着材料逐渐巩固到你的大脑中，逐渐延长重复之间的时间。通过在你更加确信掌握了材料后增加重复间隔，你将能更牢固地把它们锁定。像 Anki 这样的优秀闪卡系统，内置了从几天到几个月的重复算法。有趣的是，记住人名的最佳方法之一，就是在学习名字之后，尝试在逐渐增加的时间间隔中从记忆中提取人名。

### 3.9 What is Long Term Memory?

Welcome back to Learning How to Learn. What would it be like if you couldn't learn new things, you would not be able to remember new people you met, or remember what you were told? This actually happened to a famous patient in the annals of memory research whose initials were HM. At the age of 27, HM had an operation for epilepsy that took out his hippocampus on both sides of his brain. The hippocampus has a shape of a seahorse and is named from the Greek hippos, meaning horse and kampos, meaning sea monster. The operation was a success. The epilepsy was cured but the price was steep. HM could no longer remember new things. He had become profoundly amnesic. Curiously, you could have a normal conversation with HM, but if you left the room for a few minutes, he could not remember you or what you had discussed. In the film Memento, the character played by Guy Pearce had this form of amnesia from a concussion. Note that he tattooed his body with messages, so that he would not forget what he had to do. HM could learn other things, like a new motor skill, but he could not remember having learned it. There are multiple memory systems for different types of learning. From the studying HM and animals with similar operations, we have learned that the hippocampus is important part of a brain system for learning and memory of facts and events. Without the hippocampus and its inputs, it is not possible to store new memories in the cortex, a process called memory consolidation that can take many years. HM could remember things from his childhood but he had trouble remembering things that had occurred in the years just before his operation, things that had not yet become fully consolidated. Something similar happens when you have a bad concussion but this usually resolves, unlike HM who never improved. Memories are not fixed but living, breathing parts of your brain that are changing all of the time. Whenever you recall a memory, it changes, a process called, reconsolidation. It is even possible to implant false memories, which are indistinguishable from real ones by simply suggesting and imagining, especially in children who have vivid imaginations. Here is a summary: The green process of consolidation takes the brain state in active memory and stores it in long term memory by modifying synapses on the dendrites of neurons. These long term memories can remain dormant for a long time until the memory is retrieved and reinstated, by the red process, in short term working memory. The reinstated memory is in a new context, which can itself be transferred to long term memory, thereby, altering the old memory through reconsolidation. Our memories are intertwined with each other. As we learn new things, our old memories also change. Like consolidation, reconsolidation also occurs during sleep. This is why it is more effective to space learning over time, rather than mass learning all at once. If you want to study something for an hour, you will retain it longer if you spend 10 minutes each month over a semester than an hour on one day. In contrast, if you wait until the day before an exam to cram the material, you may be able to retrieve for the next day on the exam but it will quickly fade from memory.

欢迎回来学习如何学习。如果你无法学习新事物，无法记住新认识的人或听到的内容，会是什么样的情形呢？这在记忆研究的历史上发生在一位著名患者身上，他的名字是HM。27岁时，HM因癫痫接受了手术，切除了他大脑两侧的海马体。海马体形状像海马，得名于希腊语中的“hippos”（马）和“kampos”（海怪）。手术成功，癫痫得以治愈，但代价却是沉重的。HM再也无法记住新事物，变得严重失忆。有趣的是，你可以与HM进行正常的对话，但如果你离开房间几分钟，他就无法记起你或你们讨论的内容。

在电影《记忆碎片》中，盖·皮尔斯饰演的角色也患有类似的失忆症，他通过在身上刺字来提醒自己必须做的事情。HM能够学习新的运动技能，但他无法记得自己曾经学过这些技能。不同类型的学习对应着大脑的多种记忆系统。通过研究HM和类似的动物，我们了解到海马体是学习和记忆事实和事件的重要部分。没有海马体及其输入，无法将新记忆存储在皮层中，这个过程称为记忆巩固，可能需要多年时间。

HM能够记住童年时期的事情，但对手术前不久发生的事件则难以记忆，因为这些事件尚未完全巩固。类似的情况也会在严重脑震荡后发生，但通常会恢复，而HM则永远没有改善。记忆不是固定的，而是大脑中不断变化的活生生的部分。每当你回忆起某个记忆时，它都会发生变化，这个过程称为再巩固（reconsolidation）。甚至可以通过暗示和想象来植入虚假记忆，这些虚假记忆与真实记忆几乎无法区分，特别是在想象力丰富的儿童中。

总结一下：绿色过程的巩固将活跃的记忆状态转化为长期记忆，通过修改神经元树突上的突触来存储。这些长期记忆可能会在长时间内保持休眠状态，直到通过红色过程在短期工作记忆中被提取和恢复。恢复的记忆处于新的上下文中，这本身也可以转移到长期记忆中，从而通过再巩固改变旧记忆。我们的记忆彼此交织，随着新事物的学习，旧记忆也会发生变化。像巩固一样，再巩固也会在睡眠中进行。这就是为什么将学习分散在时间中比一次性集中学习更有效。如果你想学习一小时，分散到整个学期每月学习十分钟，记忆的保持时间更长；而如果你在考试前一天突击复习，虽然可能第二天能在考试中回忆起来，但很快就会淡忘。

In addition to neurons, brains have several types of supporting cells called glial cells. The astrocyte is the most abundant glial cell in the human brain. Astrocytes provide nutrients to neurons, maintain extra cellular ion balance, and are involved with repair following injury. In this photo of the cortex, the astrocytes are staying green and the neurons are blue. The intricate arms of the astrocytes wrap around the neurons, each embracing thousands of synapses. A recent experiment suggest that these astrocytes may also have an important role in learning. When human astrocytes were put into mouse brains, the humanized mice learned faster. Interestingly, when Einstein's brain was examined to find out what made him so awesomely creative, the only difference that could be found was that he had many more astrocytes than the average human. Could astrocytes be the key to understanding human intelligence? Well, the more we learn about the brain, the more may we have to rethink learning. I'm Terry Sejnowski. Happy learning, until we meet again.

除了神经元，大脑还有几种支持细胞，称为胶质细胞。星形胶质细胞是人脑中最丰富的胶质细胞。星形胶质细胞为神经元提供营养，维持细胞外离子平衡，并在受伤后参与修复。在这张皮层的照片中，星形胶质细胞呈绿色，神经元呈蓝色。星形胶质细胞的复杂分支包裹着神经元，每个星形胶质细胞拥抱着成千上万的突触。

最近的一项实验表明，这些星形胶质细胞在学习中可能也发挥着重要作用。当人类星形胶质细胞被放入小鼠的大脑中时，这些“人化”的小鼠学习速度更快。有趣的是，当科学家检查爱因斯坦的大脑时，发现他与普通人最大的不同就是他的星形胶质细胞数量远超常人。星形胶质细胞是否是理解人类智力的关键？随着我们对大脑了解的加深，我们可能需要重新思考学习的方式。我是特里·赛诺斯基，祝你学习愉快，期待下次再见。



### 3.10 Creating Meaningful Groups and the Memory Palace Technique


In this video, we're going to delve deeper into memory. Another key to memorization is to create meaningful groups that simplify the material. Let's say you wanted to remember four plants that help ward off vampires. Garlic, rose, hawthorn and mustard. The first letters abbreviate to GRHM, so all you need to do to remember is use the image of a graham cracker. It's much easier to remember numbers by associating them with memorable events. The year 1965 might be when one of your relatives was born for example. Or you can associate numbers with a numerical system you're familiar with. For example, 11.0 seconds is a good running time for the 100 meter dash. Or 75 might be the number of stitches on a knitting needle for the ski hats you like to make. Personally, I like to associate numbers with the feelings of, when was I was or will be at a given age. The number 18 is an easy one. That's the age when I went out into the world. By age 104 I hope to be an old, but happy great grandma. Many disciplines use memorable sentences to help students memorize concepts. The first letter of each word in the sentence is also the first letter of each word in a list that needs to be memorized. Medicine, for example, is laden with memorable mnemonics. Among the cleaner of which are: “Some Lovers Try Positions That They Can't Handle”, to memorize the names of the carpal bones of the hand. And “Old People from Texas Eat Spiders”, for the cranial bones. Time after time, these kinds of memory tricks prove helpful. If you're memorizing something commonly used, see whether someone has come up with a particularly memorable memory trick by searching it out online. Otherwise, try coming up with your own. The memory palace technique is a particularly powerful way of grouping things you want to remember. It involves calling to mind a familiar place. Like the layout of your house, and using it as a sort of a visual notepad where you can deposit the concept images that you want to remember. All you have to do is call to mind the place you're familiar with. Your home, your route to school, or your favorite restaurant and voila in the blink of an imaginative eye this becomes the memory palace that you'll use as your notepad. The memory palace technique is useful for remembering unrelated items, such as a grocery list. Milk, bread, eggs. To use the technique, you might imagine a gigantic bottle of milk just inside your front door. The bread plopped on the couch and a cracked egg dribbling off the edge of the coffee table. In other words, you'd imagine yourself walking through a place you know well, coupled with shockingly memorable images of what you want to remember. If you're studying Finance, Sociology, Chemistry or what have you, and you have lists to remember, you could use this same approach. The first time you do this, it will be slow. It takes a bit of time to conjure up a solid mental image. But the more you do it, the quicker it becomes. One study showed that a person using the Memory Palace technique could remember more than 95% of a 40 to 50 item list after only one or two practice mental walks, where the items were placed on the grounds of the local university. In using the mind this way, memorization can become an outstanding exercise in creativity that simultaneously build neural hooks for even more creativity. Purists might sniff that using oddball memorization gimmicks isn't really learning. But researchers show that students who use this kind of tricks outperform those who don't. In addition, imaging research on how people become experts, shows that such memory tools speed up the acquisition of both chunks and big picture templates. Helping transform novices to semi experts much more quickly, even in a matter of weeks. Memory tricks allow people to expand their working memory with easy access to long term memory. What's more, the memory process itself becomes an exercise in creativity. The more you memorize using these innovative techniques, the more creative you become. This is because you're building these wild, unexpected possibilities for future connections early on. Even as you're first internalizing the ideas, the more you practice this type of memory muscle so to speak, the more easily you'll be able to remember. Where at first it may take 15 minutes to build an evocative image for an equation and embed it say, in the kitchen sink of your memory palace, it can later take only minutes or seconds to perform a similar task. You'll also realize that as you begin to internalize key aspects of the material, taking a little time to commit the most important points to memory, you come to understand it much more deeply. The formulas will mean far more to you, than they would if you simply looked them up in a book. And you'll be able to sling those formulas around much more proficiently on tests and in real world applications. You may say, well, you're just not that creative, an equation or theory could hardly have its own grandiose motivations or persnickeity emotional needs to help you understand and remember it. But always remember, your childlike creativity is still there inside you. You just need to reach out to it. I'm Barbara Oakley. Thanks for learning how to learn.
在这段视频中，我们将更深入地探讨记忆。记忆的一个关键是创建有意义的组，以简化材料。例如，如果你想记住四种可以驱赶吸血鬼的植物：大蒜、玫瑰、山楂和芥末。它们的首字母组合成GRHM，所以你只需用一个“格雷厄姆饼干”的形象来记忆。这比起仅仅记数字，要容易得多。比如，1965年可能是你某个亲戚出生的年份，或者你可以将数字与你熟悉的事件关联起来。例如，11.0秒是100米短跑的好成绩，或者75可能是你喜欢制作滑雪帽时需要的针数。

我个人喜欢将数字与我在某个特定年龄时的感觉联系起来。数字18很容易记住，因为那是我走入社会的年龄。希望到104岁时，我能成为一个快乐的曾外祖母。许多学科使用记忆句子来帮助学生记忆概念。句子中每个单词的首字母也对应需要记忆的列表中的每个单词。医学中有很多这样的记忆法，其中一些比较简洁的句子是：“Some Lovers Try Positions That They Can't Handle”，用于记忆手部的腕骨，以及“Old People from Texas Eat Spiders”，用于记忆颅骨。

这些记忆技巧经常证明是有帮助的。如果你正在记忆某个常用的内容，可以在线查找是否有人提出过特别有趣的记忆技巧。否则，尝试自己想出一些。记忆宫殿技术是一种特别有效的记忆分组方法。它涉及召唤一个熟悉的地方，比如你家的布局，并把它作为一种视觉笔记本，用于存储你想要记住的概念图像。只需想象你熟悉的地方，比如你的家、上学的路线或你最喜欢的餐厅，这样一来，它就成了你用作笔记本的记忆宫殿。

这个技术对记忆无关紧要的项目非常有用，比如购物清单：牛奶、面包、鸡蛋。你可以想象在前门内有一瓶巨大的牛奶，面包放在沙发上，而一个裂开的鸡蛋正从咖啡桌边缘滴落。换句话说，你会想象自己走过一个熟悉的地方，同时伴随着令人震惊的图像来帮助记忆。如果你在学习金融、社会学、化学等，并有列表需要记住，你可以使用这种方法。

第一次使用时，这个过程会比较慢，因为需要一些时间来召唤一个稳固的心理图像。但你越是练习，速度会越快。一项研究显示，使用记忆宫殿技术的人在仅一次或两次心理练习中，就能记住40到50个项目中的95%以上。通过这种方式使用大脑，记忆不仅可以成为创造力的出色锻炼，同时也为更多的创造力建立神经连接。

一些纯粹主义者可能会认为使用奇特的记忆技巧并不算真正的学习，但研究表明，使用这种技巧的学生表现优于那些不使用的人。此外，关于人们如何成为专家的成像研究表明，这些记忆工具能加快学习块和整体模板的获取，帮助初学者在几周内更快地转变为半专业水平。记忆技巧使人们能够扩展他们的工作记忆，并轻松访问长期记忆。更重要的是，记忆过程本身也成为创造力的锻炼。

通过这些创新技术进行记忆，能增强你在未来建立意外连接的能力。起初，建立一个生动的图像可能需要15分钟，但随着练习，这个时间可以缩短到几分钟甚至几秒钟。你会发现，当你开始内化材料的关键方面时，花一点时间将最重要的点记住，会使你对内容理解得更深入。公式对你来说意义重大，而不是简单地查阅书籍，你在考试和实际应用中也能更熟练地运用这些公式。

你可能会说，你的创造力不强，一个方程或理论根本没有宏伟的动机或情感需求来帮助你理解和记忆。但请始终记住，你内心的童年创造力仍然存在。你只需要去触及它。我是芭芭拉·奥克利，感谢你学习如何学习。



### 3.11 Summary Week 3

Learning to use your memory in a more disciplined yet creative manner helps you learn to focus your attention, even as you create wild diffuse connections that build stronger memories. Here are the key ideas about memory we've covered:
学习以更有纪律且创造性的方式使用记忆可以帮助你集中注意力，同时创造出丰富多样的连接，从而建立更强的记忆。以下是我们讨论的记忆的关键概念：

In this course, we discussed two main memory systems involved in your ability to chunk concepts. The first is long term memory, which is like a storage warehouse. You need to practice and repeat in order to help store items in long term memory so you can retrieve them more easily. Practicing and repeating, all in one day, is a bad idea. You want to extend your practice to several days. This is why tackling procrastination is important. It helps you build better memories because you start earlier.
长期记忆：这类似于一个存储仓库。你需要通过练习和重复来帮助将信息存储到长期记忆中，以便更轻松地提取。一天内进行大量练习和重复并不是一个好主意，最好将练习分散到几天中。这就是为什么克服拖延症很重要，它能帮助你建立更好的记忆，因为你会提早开始。

The second, is working memory, which is like a poor blackboard that quickly fades. You can only hold about four items in your working memory. When you master a technique or concept in some sense, it compacts the ideas so they can occupy less space in your working memory when you do bring them to mind. This frees your mental thinking space so that it can more easily grapple with other ideas.
工作记忆：这就像一个容易消失的黑板，你只能在工作记忆中保持大约四个项目。当你掌握某个技巧或概念时，它会将这些想法压缩，占用更少的工作记忆空间。这释放了你的思维空间，使你能更轻松地处理其他想法。

We have outstanding visual and spatial memory systems. If you tap into those systems, it will help improve your memory. To begin tapping into your visual memory system, try making a very memorable visual image representing one key item you want to remember. Beyond merely seeing, try to feel, to hear and even to smell something you're trying to remember. The funnier and more evocative the image is, the better. As always, repetition over several days is really helpful.
视觉和空间记忆：我们拥有出色的视觉和空间记忆系统。利用这些系统可以提高你的记忆效果。要开始利用你的视觉记忆系统，可以尝试制作一个非常有记忆点的视觉图像，代表你想要记住的一个关键项目。超越单纯的视觉感知，尝试去感受、聆听，甚至嗅到你试图记住的东西。图像越搞笑、越生动，效果就越好。像往常一样，分散在几天中的重复练习是非常有帮助的。

Another key to memorization is to create meaningful groups that simplify the material. Try associating numbers with years or with systems you're familiar with like running times. Many disciplines use memorable sentences. The memory palace technique, placing memorable images in a scene that's familiar to you, allows you to dip into the strength of your visual memory system, providing a particularly powerful way of grouping things you want to remember. By making meaningful groups and abbreviations, you can simplify and chunk what you're trying to learn so you can more easily store it in memory. And by memorizing material you understand, you can internalize the material in a profound way. You're reinforcing the mental library you need to become a genuine master of the material. Happy memories!
另一个记忆的关键是创建有意义的组，以简化材料。试着将数字与年份或你熟悉的系统（比如跑步时间）联系起来。许多学科使用易于记忆的句子。记忆宫殿技巧允许你在熟悉的场景中放置可记忆的图像，利用你视觉记忆系统的优势，这是分组你想记住的内容的一种特别强大的方法。通过创建有意义的组和缩写，你可以简化和分块你正在学习的内容，从而更容易将其存储在记忆中。通过记忆你理解的材料，你可以深刻内化这些内容，强化你成为真正掌握该材料所需的心理库。祝你记忆愉快！

### 4.1 How to Become a Better Learner

Welcome back to Learning How to Learn. Today we're going to talk about how to become a better learner. As we learn more about the brain we can become better learners, and here are two tips for how to learn better. Tip number one – the best gift that you can give your brain is Physical Exercise. We once thought that all of the neurons in your brain were already present at birth, but we now know that in a few places, new neurons are born every day. One of these places is in your Hippocampus, a brain area that is very important for learning new things that we already discussed earlier in the course. In this experiment, a rat is shown, learning how to distinguish a picture of a flower from a picture of an airplane. In the background is a photo of neurons in the hippocampus, with the old neurons shown in blue and newly generated neurons in red. As the rat learns the task, these new neurons are recruited to help perform better pattern separation between the two pictures. These new neurons help you learn new things but they will die if you don't use them. New experiences will rescue them. Exercise, interestingly, also helps new neurons survive. Exercise is by far, more effective than any drug on the market today to help you learn better. It benefits all of your vital organisms, not just your brain. It is unfortunate that schools are dropping gym and recess to make room for more instruction. Gym and recess are by far the most important parts of the curriculum. Here's another tip – and this has to do with practice making perfect, but only when your brain is prepared. There are certain critical periods in the development of your brain. When sudden improvements occur in specific abilities, expect them to happen and prepare your brain for them. The critical period for first language acquisition extends up to puberty. One of the best studied critical periods in the brain is when binocular depth perception or stereopsis matures during the first two years of life. Stereopsis is the magic behind Magic Eye pictures like the one shown here. If you stare at this image and slightly cross your eyes, you will see staircases pop out of the page. There is a slight shift between the images in the two eyes and your brain interprets this slight shift as difference in depth. Not everyone, however, can see this. Over 5% of the population is stereo blind. If the two eyes are not properly aligned during the first two years of development, the neurons in your visual cortex will fail to properly strengthen the inputs from the two eyes and depth perception is permanently impaired. Well, that's the dogma. Sue Barry, a friend of mine from graduate school at Princeton, was able to recover stereo vision through eye exercises, and wrote a book about it, entitled Fixing My Gaze, a Scientist's Journey Into Seeing in Three Dimensions. Practice can repair, as well as train the brain. But this takes much longer, past the critical period. This brings us to zombies. Zombies can't learn. It is also clear from their behavior that they have brain damage. Especially in the front of their cortex, which is the part that makes plans, as well as in their language areas. Learning, planning, language, these are the skills that make us human. The prefrontal cortex is also involved in complex analysis in social behaviors, as well as decision making and planning. It is the last part of the cortex to mature, so until this happens, there may be a little bit of zombie in you.
欢迎回来《学习如何学习》。今天我们将讨论如何成为更好的学习者。随着我们对大脑了解的深入，以下是两条提高学习能力的建议。

**建议一**——给予大脑最好的礼物是身体锻炼。我们曾认为大脑中的神经元在出生时就已全部存在，但现在我们知道，在某些地方，每天都有新的神经元诞生。其中一个地方是海马体，这是一个对学习新事物非常重要的脑区。在实验中，一只老鼠学习区分花和飞机的图片。图像中显示的海马体神经元，旧神经元用蓝色表示，新生成的神经元用红色表示。随着老鼠学习这个任务，这些新神经元被招募来帮助更好地区分这两张图片。新的神经元有助于你学习新事物，但如果不使用它们，它们会死亡。新体验可以拯救它们。值得注意的是，锻炼还帮助新神经元存活。锻炼在提高学习能力方面比任何药物都要有效得多。遗憾的是，学校为了增加授课时间而削减了体育和休息时间。体育和休息是课程中最重要的部分。

**建议二**——这与“实践造就完美”有关，但前提是你的大脑已经准备好。大脑的发展有一些关键期，这时特定能力会突然提高，要期待这些并为之做好准备。第一语言习得的关键期延续到青春期。在大脑中，双眼深度知觉（立体视）的成熟是一个研究得很透彻的关键期，这一过程发生在生命的前两年。立体视是“魔法眼”图像的原理，如果你凝视这幅图像并稍微交叉眼睛，就会看到立体阶梯从页面中跳出来。这是因为两只眼睛图像之间的轻微偏移使大脑将这种差异解读为深度差异。然而，并不是每个人都能看到这一点，超过5%的人口是立体盲。如果在发育的前两年中，两只眼睛未能正确对齐，视觉皮层中的神经元就无法正确增强两只眼睛的输入，深度知觉会受到永久性损害。这是传统观点。然而，我的朋友苏·巴里在普林斯顿的研究生时期通过眼睛锻炼恢复了立体视，并写了一本书《修复我的凝视：科学家在三维世界中的探索》。练习不仅可以训练大脑，还能修复大脑，但这需要更长的时间，超出关键期。

这让我们谈到僵尸。僵尸无法学习。从它们的行为也可以清楚看出它们有大脑损伤，尤其是在前额皮层，这部分负责计划，以及语言区域。学习、计划、语言——这些是让我们成为人类的技能。前额皮层还涉及复杂的社会行为分析、决策和计划。这是大脑皮层最后成熟的部分，因此在这一成熟之前，你可能还会有一点“僵尸”的特质。

Another patient, EVR, suffered a stroke in the social parts of his prefrontal cortex. EVR had a high IQ and seemed normal, but he was ruined by making bad financial decisions and bad social interactions. He lost both his home and his family. Good judgment takes a long time, and a lot of experience to acquire. Learning is too important to be left behind in the classroom. Learning to learn is a skill you can master, and you can use it to improve every part of your life. You'll be learning even more learning tips this week, and can follow up on them at http://www.brainfacts.org/. I'm Terry Sejnowski, happy learning to you until we meet again.

### 4.2 Introduction to Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential

This week we are going to wrap up a slew of important ideas, and techniques that will help round out and enhance your ability to learn well, using metaphors and analogies, to work profitable with teammates, and not undercut your own strengths, and finally to perform well on tests. One important thought though, before we launch into this week's videos, learning doesn't progress logically, so that each day just adds an additional neat package to your knowledge shelf. Sometimes you hit a wall in constructing your understanding. Things that made sense before can suddenly seem confusing. This type of knowledge collapse seems to occur when your mind is restructuring its understanding, building a more solid foundation. In the case of language learners, they experience occasional periods when the foreign language suddenly seems completely incomprehensible. Remember it takes time to assimilate new knowledge. You'll inevitably go through some periods when you seem to take and exasperating step backwards, in your understanding. This is a natural phenomenon, that means that your mind is wrestling deeply with the material. You'll find that when you emerge from these periods of temporary frustration, your knowledge base will take a surprising leap forward. I'm Barbara Oakley, thanks for learning how to learn.
这一周，我们将总结一系列重要的观点和技巧，帮助你全面提升学习能力，包括使用隐喻和类比、与团队成员有效合作、发挥自身优势，以及在考试中表现出色。不过，在我们进入本周的视频之前，有一点重要的想法：学习并不是按逻辑进展的，每天的学习并不只是将知识整齐地添加到你的知识架子上。有时你会在理解构建上遇到瓶颈，以前明白的内容突然变得混乱。语言学习者在学习过程中也会经历这种现象，偶尔会觉得外语变得完全难以理解。请记住，吸收新知识需要时间。你不可避免地会经历一些时期，感觉自己的理解在令人沮丧地倒退。这是一个自然现象，意味着你的大脑正在与材料进行深入的较量。当你走出这些暂时的挫折期时，你的知识基础将会意外地向前跃进。 我是Barbara Oakley，感谢你学习如何学习。



### 4.3 Create a Lively Visual Metaphor of Analogy

One of the best things you can do to not only remember, but understand concepts, is to create a metaphor or analogy for them; often the more visual the better. A metaphor is just a way of realizing that one thing is somehow similar to another. Simple ideas like one geography teacher's description of Syria is shaped like a bowl of cereal, and Jordan as a Nike Air Jordan sneaker, can stick with a student for decades. If you're trying to understand electrical current, it can help to visualize it as water. Similarly, electrical voltage can feel like pressure. A push. As you climb to a more sophisticated understanding of whatever topic you're concentrating on, you can revise your metaphors or toss them away and create more meaningful ones. Metaphors and visualization, being able to see something in your mind's eye, have been especially helpful not only in art and literature, but also in allowing the scientific and engineering world to make progress. In the 1800s for example, when chemists began to imagine and visualize the miniature world of molecules, dramatic progress began to be made. Here's a fun illustration of monkeys in a benzene ring from an insider spoof of German Academic Chemical Life printed in 1886. Note the single bonds, or the monkeys' hands, and the double bonds with their tiny little tails. It's often helpful to pretend that you are the concept you're trying to understand. Put yourself in an electron's warm and fuzzy slippers as it burrows through a slab of copper. Or sneak inside the X of an algebraic equation and feel what it's like to poke your head out of the rabbit hole. But just don't let it get exploded by an inadvertent divide by zero. In chemistry, compare a Cation with a cat that has paws and is therefore pawsitive. And an Anion with an onion that's negative, because it makes you cry. Metaphors are never perfect, but then in science, all models are just metaphors which means they break down at some point. But never mind that. Metaphors and models are often vitally important in giving a physical understanding of the central idea behind the process or concept you are trying to understand. Interestingly, metaphors and analogies are useful for getting people out of Einstellung, that is, being blocked by thinking about a problem in the wrong way. For example, telling a simple story of soldiers attacking a fortress from many different directions at once can open creative paths for students to see how many lowintensity rays can be effectively used to destroy a cancerous tumor. Stories, even if they're just used as silly memory tricks, can also allow you to more easily retain what you're trying to learn. Metaphors also help glue an idea into your mind because they make a connection to neural structures that are already there. It's like being able to trace a pattern with tracing paper. Metaphors at least help you get a sense of what's going on.
你能做的最好的事情之一，不仅是记住概念，还能理解它们，就是为它们创建隐喻或类比；通常越直观越好。隐喻就是一种意识到某件事与另一件事相似的方式。例如，一位地理老师将叙利亚比作一碗谷物，约旦比作一双耐克Air Jordan运动鞋，这样的简单比喻可以在学生心中留下数十年的印记。如果你试图理解电流，想象它如同水流动可能会有所帮助。同样，电压则可以视作压力，一种推动力。随着你对所关注的主题逐渐深入理解，你可以修订你的隐喻，或者抛弃旧的，创造出更有意义的。

隐喻和可视化，能够在你的脑海中看到某些事物，尤其在艺术和文学中发挥了重要作用，也帮助科学和工程界取得进展。例如，在19世纪，当化学家们开始想象和可视化分子的小世界时，显著的进展开始出现。这里有一个有趣的插图，描绘了在苯环中的猴子，出自1886年德国学术化学生活的内部玩笑。注意单键或猴子的手，以及双键和它们的小尾巴。

假装你是你试图理解的概念往往会很有帮助。想象自己穿着电子的温暖舒适的拖鞋，钻进一块铜的内部。或者偷偷潜入代数方程的X中，感受一下从兔子洞探出头的感觉。只要别让它因不小心除以零而爆炸。在化学中，可以将阳离子（Cation）比作一只有爪子的猫，因此是“正”（pawsitive）的；而将阴离子（Anion）比作一颗使你流泪的洋葱，因此是“负”的。隐喻从来不是完美的，但在科学中，所有模型都只是隐喻，这意味着它们在某个点上会崩溃。不过没关系，隐喻和模型常常在给予你所尝试理解的过程或概念的中心思想的物理理解方面至关重要。

有趣的是，隐喻和类比对帮助人们摆脱“Einstellung”现象，即因以错误的方式思考问题而被阻碍，十分有用。例如，讲述一个士兵们从多个方向同时攻击堡垒的简单故事，可以为学生打开创造性思路，让他们看到多少低强度射线可以有效地用于摧毁癌性肿瘤。故事，即使只是作为可笑的记忆技巧，也能让你更容易地记住你试图学习的内容。隐喻还帮助将一个想法固定在你的脑海中，因为它们与已经存在的神经结构建立了连接。就像用描图纸描摹一个图案。隐喻至少能帮助你理解事情的进行过程。



### 4.4 No Need for Genius Envy

This is a good place for us to step back and look again at chunking from another perspective. Notice what we're doing here. We're interleaving our learning by jumping back to revisit and deepen our understanding of a topic we've already covered. There's an interesting connection between learning math and science and learning a sport. In baseball, for example, you don't learn how to hit in one day. Instead, your body perfects your swing from lots and lots of repetition over a period of years. Smooth repetition creates muscle memory, so your body knows what to do from a single thought, one chunk, instead of having to recall all the complex steps involved in hitting a ball. In the same way, once you understand why you do something in math and science, you don't have to keep re-explaining the how to yourself every time you do it. It's not necessary to go around with a hundred beans in your pocket and to lay out ten rows of ten beans again and again so you get that ten times ten is equal to 100. At some point you just know it from memory. For example you memorize the idea that you simply add exponents, those little superscript numbers, when you are multiplying numbers that have the same base. Ten to the fourth times ten to the fifth is equal to ten to the ninth. If you use the procedure a lot, by doing many different types of problems you'll find that you understand both the why and the how behind the procedure far better than you do after getting a conventional explanation from a teacher or a book. The greater understanding results from the fact that your mind constructed the patterns of meaning, rather than simply accepting what someone else has told you. Remember, people learn by trying to make sense out of the information they perceive. They rarely learn anything complex simply by having someone else tell it to them. Chess masters, emergency room physicians, fighter pilots, and many other experts often have to make complex decisions rapidly. They shut down their conscious system and instead rely on their well-trained intuition, drawing on their deeply ingrained repertoire of chunks. At some point selfconsciously understanding why you do what you do, just slows you down and interrupts the flow resulting in worse decisions. But wait, are chess masters and people who can multiply six digit numbers in their heads exceptionally gifted? Not necessarily. I'm going to tell it to you straight. Sure intelligence matters. Being smarter often equates to having a larger working memory. Your hot rod of a memory may be able to hold nine things in mind instead of four and you can latch on to those things like a bulldog, which makes it easier to learn. But guess what, it also makes it more difficult for you to be creative. How's that? It's our old friend and enemy Einstellung. The idea you are already holding in mind can block you from fresh thoughts. A superb working memory can hold its thoughts so tightly that new thoughts can't easily peek through. Such tightly controlled attention could use an occasional whiff of ADHD-like fresh air, the ability, in other words, to have your attention shift even if you don't want it to shift. If you're one of those people who can't hold a lot in mind at once, you lose focus and start daydreaming in lectures and have to get to some place quiet to focus so you can use your working memory to its maximum, well welcome to the clan of the creative. Having a somewhat smaller working memory means you can more easily generalize your learning into new, more creative combinations. Because your working memory, which grows from the focusing abilities of the prefrontal cortex doesn't lock everything up so tightly. You can more easily get input from other parts of your brain. These other areas, which include the sensory cortex, not only are more in tune with what's going on around you in the environment, but are also the source of dreams, not to mention creative ideas. You may have to work harder sometimes or even much of the time to understand what's going on. But once you get something chunked you can take that chunk and turn it outside in and inside round, putting it through creative paces even you didn't think you were capable of. Here's another point to put into your mental chunker: it is practice, particularly deliberate practice on the toughest aspects of the material that can help lift average brains into the realm of those with more natural gifts. Just as you can practice lifting weights and get bigger muscles over time, you can also practice certain mental patterns that deepen and enlarge in your mind. Whether you’re naturally gifted or you have to struggle to get a solid grasp of the fundamentals, you should realize that you're not alone if you think you're an imposter. That it's a fluke when you happen to do well on a test, and then on the next test, for sure they, and your family and friends, are finally going to figure out how incompetent you really are. This feeling is so extraordinarily common that it even has a name – The Imposter Syndrome. If you suffer from these kinds of feelings of inadequacy just be aware that many others secretly share them. Everyone has different gifts, as the old saying goes, when one door closes, another opens. Keep your chin up and your eye on the open door. I'm Barbara Oakley. Thanks for learning how to learn.
这是一个很好的机会让我们从另一个角度重新审视“块化”学习。我们在这里所做的，就是通过跳回去重温和加深对已学主题的理解，从而实现交错学习。学习数学和科学与学习运动之间存在有趣的联系。例如，在棒球中，你不会在一天内学会如何击球。相反，你的身体通过多次重复，经过多年的时间来完善挥棒动作。平滑的重复会创造出肌肉记忆，这样你的身体可以凭借一个想法，一个“块”，知道该怎么做，而不必回忆击球的所有复杂步骤。

同样，一旦你理解了你在数学和科学中所做的事情的原因，你就不必每次做时都重新解释方法。比如说，你不需要口袋里装一百颗豆子，再一次又一次地排列成十行十颗豆子的方式来记住十乘十等于一百。在某个时候，你会凭记忆就知道。例如，你会记住在乘法中，底数相同的情况下，只需将指数（那些小的上标数字）相加。十的四次方乘以十的五次方等于十的九次方。如果你多做不同类型的问题，通过不断的练习，你会发现你对程序背后的“为什么”和“怎么做”理解得更深刻，而不仅仅是从老师或书本那里得到常规解释。更深的理解源于你的大脑构建了意义的模式，而不是简单地接受别人告诉你的东西。

记住，人们通过努力理解他们感知的信息来学习。他们很少通过别人的讲解来学习复杂的内容。象棋大师、急救室医生、战斗机飞行员以及许多其他专家经常需要迅速做出复杂的决策。他们关闭自我意识的系统，依赖于经过良好训练的直觉，利用自己深植于脑中的块。在某个时刻，过度自我意识地理解自己所做的事情，反而会减慢你的速度，打断流畅度，从而导致更糟的决策。

但是，象棋大师和能够在脑中快速计算六位数的人真的是异常天才吗？未必。我直接告诉你，智力确实很重要。更聪明通常意味着拥有更大的工作记忆。你强大的记忆可能可以记住九个事物，而不是四个，这使得学习变得更容易。但你知道吗，这也使得你更难以发挥创造力。这是因为我们的老朋友“Einstellung”现象。你脑中已经存在的想法可能会阻碍新的思维。出色的工作记忆能够紧紧地抓住想法，以至于新想法无法轻易地冒出来。这种高度集中注意力的状态有时需要偶尔的“ADHD式新鲜空气”，即在你不想转移注意力的时候也能转变。

如果你是那种无法一次记住很多东西的人，你可能会在讲座中失去专注，开始做白日梦，必须到一个安静的地方集中精力，以便最大限度地利用你的工作记忆，那你就加入了创造性的人群。较小的工作记忆意味着你可以更容易地将学习一般化为新的、更具创造性的组合。因为你的工作记忆，源自于前额叶皮层的集中能力，并不会将一切都锁得那么紧。你可以更容易地从大脑的其他部分获取输入。这些其他区域，包括感觉皮层，不仅更能与你周围环境中的事物保持同步，也是梦想和创造性想法的源泉。

你有时可能需要更加努力，甚至在很多时候才能理解发生了什么。但一旦你将某个概念块化，你可以反复从不同角度去思考它，甚至将其应用到你未曾想象过的创造性情境中。还有一个要记住的要点是，练习，尤其是在材料最困难的方面进行的有针对性的练习，可以帮助普通大脑提升到更自然的天赋水平。就像你可以通过举重练习来增大肌肉一样，你也可以练习某些心理模式，使它们在你的脑海中深化和扩大。

无论你是天生有才，还是需要努力掌握基础知识，如果你觉得自己是个冒名顶替者，觉得自己在考试中偶然表现良好，然后在下次考试中，朋友和家人肯定会发现你真正的无能，这种感觉是非常普遍的，甚至有一个名字——冒名顶替综合症。如果你有这样的无能感，请知道，很多人也在默默地经历着这些。每个人都有不同的天赋，正如古老的谚语所说，当一扇门关闭时，另一扇门会打开。保持乐观，关注那扇打开的门。我是Barbara Oakley，感谢你学习如何学习。



### 4.5 Change Your Thoughts Change Your Life

I love reading history and being inspired by the biographies of extraordinary people. One of the most unusual people I've ever read about, is inspiring not only because he was so extraordinary, but also, because he was so ordinary. Santiago Ramón y Cajal was a born troublemaker. In rural Spain of the 1860s, there weren't many options for oddball juvenile delinquents. So that's how at 11 years old, Cajal found himself in jail. Cajal was stubborn and rebellious. Who knew that Santiago Ramón y Cajal would one day not only earn the Nobel Prize, but eventually become known as the Father of Modern Neuroscience? Cajal was already in his early 20s when he began climbing from bad boy delinquency into the traditional study of medicine. There's evidence that myelin sheaths, the fatty insulation that helps signals move more quickly along a neuron, don't finish developing in some people until they're in their twenties. This may explain why teenagers often have trouble controlling their impulsive behavior. The wiring between the intention and the control areas of the brain isn't completely formed. When you use neural circuits however, it seems you help build the myelin sheath over them; not to mention making many other microscopic changes. Practice appears to strengthen and reinforce connections between different brain regions, creating highways between the brain's control centers and the centers that store knowledge. In Cajal's case, it seems his natural maturation processes coupled with his own efforts to develop his thinking, helped him to take control of his overall behavior. It seems people can enhance the development of their neuronal circuits by practicing thoughts that use those neurons. We're still in the infancy of understanding neural development. One thing is becoming clear, we can make significant changes in our brain by changing how we think. Cajal met and worked with many brilliant scientists through his lifetime. People who were often far smarter than he. In Cajal's autobiography however, he pointed out that although brilliant people can do exceptional work, just like anyone else they can also be careless and biased. Cajal felt the key to his own success was his perseverance. What he called the virtue of the less brilliant, coupled with his flexible ability to change his mind and admit errors. Anyone, Cajal noted, even people with average intelligence, can change their own brains so that even the least gifted can produce an abundant harvest. People like Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution has made him one of the most influential figures in human history, are often thought of as these, sort of, natural geniuses. You may be surprised to learn that much like Cajal, Darwin was a poor student in school. He washed out of medical school and ended up, to his father's horror, heading out on a round the world voyage as the ship's naturalist. Out on his own, Darwin was able to look with fresh eyes at the data he was collecting. Approaching material with a goal of learning it on your own, can give you a unique path to mastery. Often no matter how good your teacher and textbook are, it's only when you sneak off and look at other books or videos that you begin to see what you learn through a single teacher, or book, is a partial version of the full three dimensional reality of the subject, which has links to still other fascinating topics that are of your choosing. Taking responsibility for your own learning is one of the most important things you can do. Santiago Ramón y Cajal had a deep understanding, not only of how to conduct science but also of how people just interact with one another. He warned fellow learners that there will always be those who criticize or attempt to undermine any effort or achievement you make. This happens to everybody; not just Nobel Prize winners. If you do well in your studies, the people around you can feel threatened. The greater your achievement, the more other people will sometimes attack and demean your efforts. On the other hand, if you flunk a test, you also may encounter critics who throw more barbs, saying you don't have what it takes. We're often told that empathy is universally beneficial. But it's not. It's important to learn to switch on an occasional cool dispassion that helps you to not only focus on what you're trying to learn, but also to tune people out if you discover that their interests lie in undercutting you. Such undercutting is all too common, as people are often just as competitive as they are cooperative. When you're a young person, mastering such dispassion can be difficult. We're naturally excited about what we're working on, and we like to believe that everyone can be reasoned with and then, almost everyone is naturally good hearted towards us. Like Santiago Ramón y Cajal, you can take pride in aiming for success. Because of the very things that make other people say you can't do it. Take pride in who you are. Especially, in the qualities that make you different, and use them as a secret talisman for success. Use your natural contrariness to defy the always present prejudices from others about what you can accomplish. I'm Barbara Oakley. Thanks for learning about learning.
我热爱阅读历史，并从非凡人物的传记中获得灵感。我读过的最不寻常的人物之一，不仅因为他如此非凡，还因为他如此普通。圣地亚哥·拉蒙·卡哈是个天生的麻烦制造者。在1860年代的西班牙乡村，像他这样的怪胎少年没有太多选择。因此，11岁的卡哈就进了监狱。卡哈顽固而叛逆。谁能想到圣地亚哥·拉蒙·卡哈最终不仅获得了诺贝尔奖，还被称为现代神经科学之父？卡哈在20出头时开始从坏小子的身份转向医学的传统学习。有证据表明，髓鞘——帮助信号在神经元中更快移动的脂肪绝缘层——在一些人身上直到二十多岁才完成发育。这可能解释了为什么青少年常常难以控制他们的冲动行为。大脑中意图与控制区域之间的连接尚未完全形成。然而，当你使用神经回路时，似乎能够帮助构建髓鞘，并产生许多其他微观变化。练习似乎能增强和强化不同脑区之间的连接，创造出控制中心和存储知识中心之间的高速公路。在卡哈的案例中，他的自然成熟过程与他自己努力发展的思维相结合，帮助他控制了整体行为。人们似乎可以通过练习使用这些神经元的思想来增强神经回路的发展。我们对神经发展仍在初步理解阶段。一件事变得清晰，我们可以通过改变思维方式对大脑产生显著变化。卡哈在一生中与许多杰出的科学家相识并合作，他们通常比他聪明得多。然而，在卡哈的自传中，他指出，尽管聪明的人可以做出杰出的工作，但他们和其他人一样，也可能粗心和偏见。卡哈认为他自己成功的关键在于他的坚持不懈。他称之为“较不聪明者的美德”，加上他灵活的能力，能够改变自己的想法并承认错误。卡哈指出，任何人，即使是智力一般的人，也可以改变自己的大脑，使得即使是最不天赋的人也能获得丰硕的成果。像查尔斯·达尔文这样的人，其进化论使他成为人类历史上最有影响力的人物之一，通常被认为是“自然天才”。你可能会惊讶地发现，与卡哈类似，达尔文在学校里也是个差生。他从医学院辍学，最终在父亲的恐惧下，作为船上的自然学家开始了环绕世界的航行。在独自一人时，达尔文能够以新的视角审视他所收集的数据。以自主学习的目标接近材料，可以为你通向掌握提供独特的路径。无论你的老师和教科书多么优秀，只有当你偷偷去看其他书籍或视频时，你才开始看到通过单一教师或书籍所学的知识只是该主题完整三维现实的部分版本，它还与其他你选择的迷人主题相连接。对自己学习负责是你可以做的最重要的事情之一。圣地亚哥·拉蒙·卡哈不仅深刻理解如何进行科学研究，还理解人们如何相互互动。他警告同行学习者，总会有人批评或试图破坏你所做的任何努力或成就。这对每个人都适用，而不仅仅是诺贝尔奖获得者。如果你在学习中表现良好，周围的人可能会感到威胁。你的成就越大，有时其他人就越会攻击和贬低你的努力。另一方面，如果你考试不及格，你也可能会遇到更多批评者，他们会说你没有能力。我们常被告知同理心是普遍有益的，但其实并非如此。学会偶尔切换到冷静的客观状态是重要的，这不仅可以帮助你专注于正在学习的内容，还能让你在发现别人想要削弱你时，将他们排除在外。这样的削弱现象相当普遍，因为人们往往既竞争又合作。当你年轻时，掌握这种冷静可能很困难。我们对自己正在做的事情自然充满热情，喜欢相信每个人都可以进行理性对话，而几乎每个人对我们都是善意的。像圣地亚哥·拉蒙·卡哈一样，你可以为追求成功而自豪。正是那些让别人说你做不到的事情，使你更有成就感。为自己感到自豪，尤其是为那些让你与众不同的品质而感到自豪，并将这些品质作为成功的秘密护符。利用你天生的反叛精神来挑战他人对你成就的偏见。我是芭芭拉·奥克利。感谢你学习关于学习的知识。



### 4.6 The Value of Team Work

This is a CT scan. If you look carefully, the shadowed region right here reveals the damage caused by right hemisphere ischemic stroke. Such a stroke can cause an unusual condition known as broadperspective perceptual disorder of the right hemisphere. People with this disorder can still function, but only partially. They can retain their intelligence, even a formidable way for solving complex math problems, if that was a skill they'd had before. But an interesting anomaly, however, is if they make a mistake in their calculations, concluding something nonsensical, such as that a hot dog stand had a, a profit and loss statement with a loss of nearly a billion dollars. It doesn't bother them. There's no big picture; click, that says, wait a minute; that answer does not make sense. Although we need to be careful about faulty and superficial left brain, right brain assumptions. We also don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water, and ignore worthwhile research that gives intriguing hints about differences between the two hemispheres of the brain. There's a great deal of evidence from research that the right hemisphere helps us step back and put our work into big picture perspective. People with damage to the right hemisphere are often unable to gain ah-ha, insights. The right hemisphere, as it turns out, is vitally important in getting into the right track and doing reality checks. People with strokes can remind us of the dangers of not using our full cognitive abilities, which involve many areas of our brain. Even subtle avoidance of some of our capabilities can have a surprisingly negative impact on our work. In some sense, when you whiz through a homework or test question and don't go back to check your work, you're acting a little like a person who's refusing to use parts of your brain. You're not stopping to take a mental breath. And then revisit what you've done with the bigger picture in mind to see whether it makes sense. As leading neuroscientist Vilayanur S. Ramachandran has noted, the right hemisphere serves as a sort of devil's advocate to question the status quo and look for global inconsistencies. While the left hemisphere instead tries to cling tenaciously to the way things were. This echoes the pioneering work of psychologist Michael Gazzaniga who posited that the left hemisphere interprets the world for us and will go to great lengths to keep those interpretations unchanging. When you work in the focus mode, it's easy to make minor mistakes in your assumptions or calculations. If you go off track early on, it doesn't matter if the rest of your work is correct. Your answer is still wrong. Sometimes, it's even laughably wrong. The equivalent of calculating a circumference of the earth that's only two and a half feet around. But these non-sensical results just don't matter to you because the more left centered focus mode has associated with it a desire to cling to what you've done. That's the problem with the focus, sometimes a bit left hemisphere leaning mode of analysis. It provides for an analytical and upbeat approach, but abundant research evidence suggests there's a potential for rigidity, dogmatism, and egocentricity. When you're absolutely certain that what you've done on a homework or test is fine, thank you very much, be aware that this feeling may be based on overly confident perspectives arising in part from the left hemisphere. When you step back and recheck, you're allowing for more interaction between the hemispheres, taking advantage of the special perspectives and abilities of each. Nobel Prize winning physicist Richard Feynman perhaps said it best when he pointed out, the first principle is that you must not fool yourself. And you are the easiest person to fool. One of the best ways to catch your blind spots and errors is to brainstorm and work with others who are also smartly focused on the topic. It's sometimes just not enough to use more of your own neural horsepower. Both modes and hemispheres to analyze your work. After all, everyone has blind spots. You're naively upbeat focused mode can still skip right over errors, especially if you're the one who committed the original errors. Worse yet, sometimes you can blindly believe you've got everything nailed down intellectually, but you haven't. This is the kind of thing that can leave you in shock when you discover you've flunked the test you thought you aced. By making it a point to do some of your studying with friends, you can more easily catch where your thinking has gone astray. Friends and teammates can serve as sort of ever questioning larger scale diffuse mode outside your brain that can catch what you missed, or what you just can't see. And of course, explaining to friends helps build your own understanding. The importance of working with others doesn't just relate to learning. It's also important in career building. A single small tip from a teammate to take a course from the outstanding Professor Passionate, or to check out a new job opening, can make an extraordinary difference in how your life unfolds. A word of warning, however; study groups can be powerfully effective for learning, but if study sessions turn into socializing occasions, all bets are off. Keep small talk to a minimum, get your group on track. And finish your work. If you find that your group meetings start five to 15 minutes late, members haven't read the material, and the conversation consistently veers off topic, you're best off to find another group. I'm Barbra Oakley. Thanks for learning how to learn.
这是一个CT扫描。如果你仔细观察，这里阴影区域显示了右半球缺血性中风造成的损伤。这种中风可能导致一种被称为右半球广视角感知障碍的异常情况。患有这种障碍的人仍然可以运作，但只是部分地。他们可以保留智力，甚至在解决复杂数学问题时展现出卓越的能力，如果那是他们之前的技能。但有一个有趣的异常现象是，如果他们在计算中犯了错误，得出的结论荒谬，例如，一个热狗摊的损益表显示亏损近十亿美元，他们并不会在意。没有“全局视角”的警示，提醒他们“等一下，这个答案不合理”。尽管我们需要小心关于左右脑的错误和肤浅假设，但我们也不想因此忽视那些提供有趣提示的有价值研究，这些研究揭示了大脑两半球之间的差异。研究提供了大量证据表明，右半球帮助我们退后一步，将我们的工作放入全局视角。右半球受损的人通常无法获得“啊哈”的洞察。事实证明，右半球在引导我们走上正确轨道和进行现实检查方面至关重要。中风患者提醒我们不使用全面认知能力的危险，这涉及我们大脑的许多区域。即使是对我们某些能力的微妙回避，也会对我们的工作产生意想不到的负面影响。从某种意义上说，当你迅速完成作业或测试问题而不回去检查你的工作时，你的行为有点像一个拒绝使用大脑某些部分的人。你没有停下来喘口气，而是想着大局，看看自己做的是否合理。正如著名神经科学家维拉扬努·S·拉马钱德兰所指出的，右半球充当了某种“魔鬼代言人”，质疑现状并寻找全球不一致之处。而左半球则试图紧紧抓住事物的原样。这与心理学家迈克尔·加扎尼加的开创性研究相呼应，他认为左半球为我们解释世界，并会不遗余力地保持这些解释不变。当你处于专注模式时，很容易在假设或计算中犯小错误。如果你早期就走错了方向，后面的工作再正确也无济于事，你的答案依然是错的。有时，这些错误甚至是可笑的，类似于计算出地球周长只有两英尺半。但这些荒谬的结果对你来说似乎并不重要，因为更倾向于左脑的专注模式与对自己所做事情的执着有关。这正是专注模式的问题，有时稍显左半球倾向的分析模式。它提供了一种分析性和积极的方式，但大量研究证据表明，这种模式可能存在僵化、教条主义和自我中心化的潜在风险。当你绝对相信自己在作业或测试中做得很好时，请意识到这种感觉可能部分来源于过于自信的左半球视角。当你退后一步进行重新检查时，你允许两半球之间有更多的互动，利用每个半球的特殊视角和能力。诺贝尔奖得主理查德·费曼或许说得最好，他指出，“第一原则是你不能欺骗自己，而你是最容易欺骗自己的人。” 捕捉盲点和错误的最佳方法之一是与其他同样专注于主题的人一起头脑风暴和合作。仅仅依靠更多的神经能力可能还不够，必须结合两种模式和半球来分析你的工作。毕竟，人人都有盲点。你那种天真的乐观专注模式可能会跳过错误，尤其是当你就是犯错误的人时。更糟糕的是，有时你可能盲目地相信自己在智力上已经掌握了一切，但实际上并没有。这种情况可能会让你在发现自己考砸了以为自己考得不错的测试时感到震惊。通过与朋友一起学习，你可以更轻松地发现思维中的偏差。朋友和团队成员可以作为一种不断质疑的更大范围的散焦模式，捕捉到你遗漏或无法看到的东西。而且，向朋友解释也有助于加深自己的理解。与他人合作的重要性不仅与学习相关，也与职业发展密切相关。队友给出的一个小建议，例如选修杰出教授的课程，或查看新的工作机会，可能会对你的人生发展产生巨大影响。然而，值得警惕的是，学习小组虽然对学习非常有效，但如果学习会变成社交活动，那就不妙了。保持闲聊在最小范围内，确保小组专注于工作，完成任务。如果你发现小组会议总是晚到五到十五分钟，成员们没有阅读材料，而且讨论经常偏离主题，最好寻找另一个小组。我是芭芭拉·奥克利。感谢你学习如何学习。



### 4.7 A Test Checklist

We've mentioned it earlier, but it's worth repeating. Testing is itself an extraordinarily powerful learning experience. This means that the effort you put into test-taking, including the preliminary mini test of your recall and your ability to problem solve during your preparation is of fundamental importance. If you compare how much you learn by spending one hour studying, versus one hour taking a test on that same material, you'll retain and learn far more as a result of the hour you spent taking a test. Testing, it seems, has a wonderful way of concentrating the mind. Virtually everything we've talked about in this course has been designed to help make the testing process seem straightforward and natural, simply an extension of the normal procedures you use to learn the material. So it's time now to cut directly to one of the final features of this course: a checklist you can use to see whether your preparation for test taking is on target. This checklist was developed by legendary educator Richard Felder. Although, it was originally developed for engineers, it's actually suitable for many disciplines. As Doctor Felder says the answer to the question, “how should I prepare for the test?” is do whatever it takes to be able to answer, yes. Meaning, usually to most of the questions on this list:
我们之前提到过，但值得再说一遍。测试本身就是一种极其强大的学习体验。这意味着你在测试过程中投入的努力，包括你在准备时进行的初步回忆小测验和解决问题的能力，都是至关重要的。如果你比较一下花一个小时学习与花一个小时测试相同材料所学到的知识，你会发现，通过测试所花的那一个小时，你的记忆和学习效果要好得多。测试似乎有一种奇妙的方式来集中思维。本课程中我们讨论的几乎所有内容都是为了帮助测试过程看起来简单自然，成为你学习材料的正常程序的延伸。所以现在是时候直接切入本课程的最后一个特点：一个检查清单，帮助你检查测试准备是否到位。这个清单由传奇教育家理查德·费尔德（Richard Felder）开发。虽然它最初是为工程师设计的，但实际上适用于许多学科。正如费尔德博士所说，回答“我应该如何准备测试？”这个问题的答案是：做任何事情以便能够回答“是”，这通常适用于清单上的大多数问题：

Did you make a serious effort to understand the text? Just hunting for relevant worked-out examples doesn't count.
你是否认真努力理解了文本？仅仅寻找相关的示例并不算数。

Did you work with classmates on homework problems or at least check your solutions with others?
你是否和同学一起解决作业问题，或者至少与他人检查你的解决方案？

Did you attempt to outline every homework problem solution before working with classmates?
在与同学合作之前，你是否尝试给每个作业问题的解决方案做一个大纲？

Did you participate actively in homework group discussions contributing ideas and asking questions?
你是否积极参与作业小组讨论，贡献想法并提出问题？

Did you consult with the instructor or teaching assistants when you were having trouble with something?
在遇到困难时，你是否向老师或助教咨询过？

Did you understand all your homework problem solutions when they were handed in?
当你的作业解决方案交上去时，你是否理解了所有的解决方案？

Did you ask in class for explanations of homework problem solutions that weren't clear to you?
你在课堂上是否询问过那些不清楚的作业解决方案的解释？

If you had a study guide, did you carefully go through it before the test and convince yourself you could do everything on it?
如果你有学习指南，你是否在考试前仔细阅读过，并让自己相信你能做到上面的所有内容？

Did you attempt to outline lots of problem solutions quickly without spending time on the Algebra in calculations?
你是否尝试快速概述大量问题的解决方案，而没有花时间在计算的代数上？

Did you go over the study guide and problems with class mates and quiz one another?
你是否和同学一起复习学习指南和问题，并互相进行小测验？

If there was a review session before the test, did you attended and asked questions about anything you weren't sure about?
如果在考试前有复习课，你是否参加并询问了任何不确定的内容？

And lastly, did you get a reasonable night's sleep before the test? If your answer is no, your answers to all the preceding questions may not matter.
最后，在考试前你是否获得了合理的睡眠？如果你的答案是否定的，那么你之前所有问题的回答可能都不重要。

Taking a test is serious business. Just as fighter pilots and doctors go through checklists before takeoff and surgery, going through your own test preparation checklist can vastly improve your chances of success. The answer to the question “How should I prepare for the test?” becomes clear once you've filled our Doctor Felder's checklist.
参加考试是非常重要的。就像飞行员和医生在起飞和手术前会检查清单一样，自己进行考试准备清单的检查可以大大提高成功的机会。回答“我该如何准备考试？”这个问题在填写完费尔德博士的清单后变得清晰。



### 4.8 Hard Start Jump to Easy

Now that you've gotten some insight into how your brain works, we can give you some final useful tricks that can empower your test taking. The classic way students are taught to approach tests is to tackle the easiest problems first. This is based on the idea that by the time you finish the relatively simple problems, you'll be confident in handling the more difficult. This approach works for some people, mostly because, well, anything works for some people. Unfortunately, however, for many people it's counterproductive. Tough problems often need lots of time, meaning you'd want to start on them first thing on the test. Difficult problems can also scream for the creative powers of the diffuse mode. But to access the diffuse mode, you need to not be focusing on what you so badly want to solve. What to do? Easy problems first, or hard? The answer is to start with the hard problems but quickly jump to the easy ones. Here's what I mean. When the test is first handed out to you, first take a quick look to get a sense of what it involves. You should do this in any case. Then, when you start working the problems, start first with what appears to be the hardest problem. But steel yourself to pull away within the first minute or two, if you get stuck or you get a sense that you might not be on the right track. This does something exceptionally helpful. Starting hard loads the first most difficult problem in mind and then switches attention away from it. Both these activities are what allow the diffuse mode to begin its work. If your initial work on the first hard problem has unsettled you, turn next to an easy problem, and complete or do as much as you can. Then move, next, to another difficult looking problem and try to make a bit of progress. Again, change to something easier as soon as you feel yourself getting bogged down or stuck. When you return to the more difficult problems, you'll often be pleased that the next step or steps in the problem will seem to be more obvious to you. You may not be able to get all the way to the end immediately, but at least you can get further before you switch to something else of which you can make progress. In some sense, with this approach to test taking, you're being a little like an efficient chef. While you're waiting for a steak to fry, you can swiftly slice the tomato garnish and turn to season the soup and then stir the sizzling onions. The hard start jump to easy technique may make more efficient use of your brain by allowing different parts of the brain to work simultaneously on different thoughts. Using the hard start jump to easy technique on tests guarantees that you will have at least a little work done on every problem. It's also a valuable technique for helping you avoid Einstellung, getting stuck on the wrong approach - because you have a chance to look at the problem from differing perspectives. All of this is particularly important if your instructor gives you partial credit. The only trick with this approach is that you must have the self-discipline to pull yourself off a problem once you find yourself stuck for a minute or two. For most students it's easy, for others it takes discipline and willpower. This may be why test takers sometimes find that the solution pops to mind right as they walk out the door; when they give up, their attention switched, allowing the diffuse mode the tiny bit of traction it needed to go to work and return the solution. Too late of course. Sometimes, people are concerned that starting a problem and then pulling away from it might cause confusion on an examination. This doesn't seem to be a problem for most people. After all, chefs learn to bring various facets of a dinner together. But if you still have worries about whether this strategy might work for you, try it first on homework problems. Also keep in mind that if you haven't prepared well for a test, then all bets are off. Just take what simple points you can.
现在你对大脑的运作有了一些了解，我们可以给你一些最终的有用技巧，以增强你的考试能力。学生们通常被教导的经典方法是先解决最简单的问题。这一思路是基于这样的想法：当你完成相对简单的问题时，你会对处理更困难的问题充满信心。这种方法对某些人有效，主要是因为任何方法对某些人都是有效的。然而，不幸的是，对于许多人来说，这种方法是适得其反的。困难的问题通常需要很多时间，这意味着你应该在考试的第一时间就开始解决它们。困难的问题还需要扩散模式的创造力，但要激活扩散模式，你必须不集中在你想要解决的问题上。那么该怎么办呢？先解决简单问题，还是先解决困难问题？答案是先解决困难问题，然后快速转向简单问题。

我的意思是，当考试刚发给你时，先快速浏览一下，了解一下内容。这是任何情况下都应该做的。然后，当你开始解题时，首先选择看起来最困难的问题。但如果你在前一分钟或两分钟内感到卡住，或者觉得可能走错了方向，就要准备迅速转移注意力。这会非常有帮助。首先着手解决困难的问题，并在此过程中转移注意力。这两项活动都有助于扩散模式开始工作。如果你在第一道困难问题上的初步工作让你感到不安，接下来就转向一个简单的问题，完成或尽可能多地解决。然后再转向另一个看起来困难的问题，尝试取得一些进展。同样地，一旦感到被困住，就立即切换到更简单的问题。当你再次回到更困难的问题时，通常会发现下一个步骤似乎更清晰。你可能无法立刻解决所有问题，但至少你能在切换到其他问题之前取得更大的进展。在某种意义上，这种考试方法就像是一个高效的厨师。当你等待牛排煎熟时，可以迅速切片番茄装饰，调味汤，然后搅拌在煎的洋葱。

这种“困难开始，快速转向简单”的技巧能够更有效地利用你的大脑，让大脑的不同部分同时处理不同的思考。在考试中使用这种方法，可以确保你在每个问题上都有至少一些进展。这也是一个有价值的技巧，帮助你避免固定思维，能够从不同的角度看待问题。所有这些对于你的老师给予部分分数时尤其重要。这种方法的唯一窍门是，你必须有自律，一旦发现自己在某个问题上卡住一两分钟，就要拉开距离。对于大多数学生来说，这很简单，但对其他人来说需要自律和意志力。这可能就是为什么考生有时在走出门时，恰好想到了问题的解决方案；当他们放弃时，注意力转移，让扩散模式获得了一点点必要的动力去工作并找回解决方案。不过那时就太晚了。有时，人们担心开始一个问题后又转开可能会在考试中造成困惑。这对大多数人来说似乎并不是问题。毕竟，厨师学会了将晚餐的各个方面结合在一起。但如果你仍然担心这种策略是否适合你，可以先在家庭作业问题上尝试一下。同时请记住，如果你没有为考试做好充分准备，那么一切都不一定有效。尽量获取你能得到的简单分数。



### 4.9 Final Helpful Hints for Tests

If you're a stressed out test taker, keep in mind that the body puts out chemicals such as cortisol when it's under stress. This can cause sweaty palms, a racing heart, a knot on the pit of your stomach. But interestingly, research finds, it's how you interpret these symptoms. The story you tell yourself about why you're stressed makes all the difference. If you shift your thinking from, this test has made me afraid, to this test has got me excited to do my best. It can really improve your performance. Another good tip for panicky test takers is to momentarily turn your attention to your breathing. Relax your stomach, place your hand on it, and slowly draw a deep breath. Your hand should move out, even as your whole chest is expanding outward like a barrel. By doing this type of deep breathing, you're counteracting the fight or flight response that fuels anxiety. This calms you down. But don't just start this breathing on the day of the test. If you practice this breathing technique in the weeks before, just a minute or two here or there is all it takes. You'll slide more easily into the breathing pattern during the test.
如果你是一位感到压力的考生，请记住，身体在压力下会分泌如皮质醇这样的化学物质。这可能会导致出汗、心跳加速和胃部紧绷。但有趣的是，研究发现，解释这些症状的方式非常重要。你对自己所感受到的压力的故事会影响表现。如果你把想法从“这场考试让我感到害怕”转变为“这场考试让我充满激情，想要做到最好”，你的表现会有所改善。

另一个对焦虑的考生有用的建议是，暂时将注意力转向呼吸。放松你的腹部，手放在上面，慢慢深吸一口气。你的手应该随着腹部的扩张而移动，整个胸部像桶一样膨胀。通过这种深呼吸，你可以抵消导致焦虑的“战斗或逃跑”反应，从而让自己冷静下来。但不要在考试当天才开始练习这种呼吸技巧。如果在考试前的几周里，每天花一两分钟练习一下，你会在考试时更容易进入这种呼吸模式。

Remember, practice makes permanent. It's especially helpful deliberately moving to a deep breathing pattern in those final anxious moments before a test is handed out. I've gotten great tips on test taking from top professors from around the world. And here are some of the best. Susan Sajna-Hebert, a professor of psychology at Lakehead University, advises her students to cover up the answers to multiple choice questions and to try to recall the information. So they can answer the question on their own first. If her students might complain that the practice test was way easier than the real one, she asks, what makes the two situations different? When you took the practice test, were you at home relaxing with toons on? Taking it with a fellow student? No time limit?
请记住，练习使得技能牢固。特别是在考试发放前的焦虑时刻，有意识地转向深呼吸模式是非常有帮助的。我从世界各地的顶尖教授那里获得了一些关于考试的好建议，以下是一些最佳建议。

来自湖首大学的心理学教授Susan Sajna-Hebert建议她的学生在面对多项选择题时，先遮住答案，尝试回忆相关信息，以便自己先回答问题。如果她的学生抱怨模拟考试比真实考试容易，她会问，这两种情况有什么不同？你是在家放松时做模拟考试吗？是和同学一起做的？没有时间限制吗？

Did you have the answer key and class materials at hand? These circumstances are not exactly like a crowded classroom with a clock ticking away and no way to access the answers. Tracy Magrann, a professor of biological sciences at Saddleback College, tells her students to face your fears. Often, your worst fear is not to get the grade you need for your chosen career. How can you handle this? Simple. Have a Plan B for the alternative career. Once you have a plan for the worst possible contingency, you'll be surprised that the fear will begin to subside. Professor Magrann notes, study hard up until the day of the test and then let it go. Tell yourself, oh well, let me just see how many questions I can get right. I can always pursue my other career choice. That helps release stress, so you can actually do better and get closer to your first career choice. And Bob Bradshaw, a professor of math at Ohlone College, tells his students about good worry and bad worry.
你手边有没有答案钥匙和课堂材料？这些情况并不完全像一个拥挤的教室，钟表在滴答作响，而你无法访问答案。Saddleback College的生物科学教授Tracy Magrann建议她的学生直面自己的恐惧。通常，你最害怕的事情就是没有得到你所需的成绩来实现你选择的职业。怎么处理这个问题呢？很简单，制定一个备用计划。只要你有了应对最坏情况的计划，你会惊讶地发现，恐惧感开始减轻。Magrann教授指出，要在考试前努力学习，然后放下心态。告诉自己，哦，好吧，我就看看能答对多少题。反正我可以选择其他职业。这有助于减轻压力，从而让你表现得更好，更接近你的首选职业。

Ohlone College的数学教授Bob Bradshaw告诉他的学生，良好的担忧和不良的担忧之间的区别。

Good worry helps provide motivation and focus, while bad worry simply wastes energy. Here are a few final thoughts. The day before a test, or tests, have a quick, final look over the materials to brush up on them. You'll need both your focus mode and diffuse mode muscles, so to speak, the next day. So you don't want to push your brain too hard. You wouldn't run a ten mile race the day before running a marathon. Don't feel guilty if you can't seem to get yourself to work too hard the day before a big examination. If you prepared properly, this seems to be a natural reaction, almost as if you're subconsciously pulling back to conserve mental energy.
好的担忧有助于提供动力和集中注意力，而不良担忧则只是浪费精力。以下是一些最后的建议。在考试前一天，快速浏览一下材料以温习一下。你在第二天需要同时调动专注模式和发散模式的大脑，所以不想过度压榨大脑。你不会在马拉松前一天跑十英里。若在大考试前一天你无法让自己工作得太辛苦，不要感到内疚。如果你已经做好了充分准备，这似乎是一种自然反应，几乎就像你在潜意识里拉回自己以节省心理能量。

While taking a test, you should also remember how your mind can trick you into thinking that what you've done is correct, even if it isn't. This means whenever possible, you should blink, shift your attention, and then double check your answers using a, a big picture prospective asking yourself, does this really makes sense. There's often more than one way to answer a question and checking your answers from different perspectives provides a golden opportunity for verifying what you've done. If there's no other way to check, except to step back through your logic, keep in mind that simple issues have tripped up even the most advanced students. Just do your best. In science classes, having your units of measurement match on each side of the equation can provide an important clue about whether what you've done is correct. The order in which you work tests is also important.
在考试时，你还应该记住，自己的思维可能会欺骗你，让你觉得所做的答案是正确的，即使实际上并非如此。这意味着在可能的情况下，你应该眨眼、转移注意力，然后从整体的角度仔细检查你的答案，问问自己：“这真的有意义吗？”通常回答一个问题有不止一种方法，从不同的角度检查答案提供了验证你所做工作的绝佳机会。如果没有其他方法可以检查，除了通过逻辑回顾你的思路，记住即使是最先进的学生也可能会被简单的问题绊倒。尽你所能而为。在科学课上，确保方程两侧的测量单位一致，可以为你所做的是否正确提供重要线索。你在考试中处理问题的顺序也很重要。

Students generally work tests from front to back. When you're checking your work if you start more towards the back and work towards the front, it sometimes seems to give your brain a fresher perspective that can allow you to more easily catch errors. Nothing's ever certain. Occasionally you can study hard and the test gods simply don't cooperate, but if you prepare well by practicing and building a strong mental library, and you approach test taking wisely, you'll find that luck will increasingly be on your side.
学生通常从考试的前面开始做起。当你检查自己的答案时，如果从后面开始往前工作，有时会让你的大脑获得更新鲜的视角，更容易发现错误。尽管没有什么是绝对的，偶尔你可能会努力学习，但考试的“神明”并不配合；但如果你通过练习和建立强大的知识库做好准备，并且明智地面对考试，你会发现运气会越来越偏向你。



### 4.10 Summary Week 4

This week, we've done a wide sweep through some of the deepest aspects of learning.
这一周，我们深入探讨了学习的一些深层次方面。

Metaphors and analogies aren't just for art and literature. One of the best things you can do to not only remember, but more easily understand concepts in many different fields, is to create a metaphor or analogy for them. Often, the more visual, the better.
隐喻和类比不仅仅属于艺术和文学。创建隐喻或类比不仅可以帮助记忆，还能更轻松地理解各个领域的概念。通常，越形象越好。

We've learned from Nobel Prize winner Santiago Ramón y Cajal that if you change your thoughts, you can really, truly change your life. It seems people can enhance the development of their neuronal circuits by practicing thoughts that use those neurons. Like Santiago Ramón y Cajal, you can take pride in aiming for success because of the very things that make other people say you can't do it.
我们从诺贝尔奖得主圣地亚哥·拉蒙·卡哈尔那里了解到，改变思维真的可以改变生活。人们可以通过练习特定的思维来增强神经元的发育。像卡哈尔一样，你可以因追求成功而感到自豪，这正是让别人说你做不到的原因。

Keep in mind that when you whiz through a homework or test question and you don't go back to check your work, you're acting a little like a person who is refusing to use parts of your brain. You're not stopping to take a mental breath and then revisit what you've done with the bigger picture in mind, to see whether it makes sense.
请记住，当你快速完成作业或考试问题而不去检查时，就像是拒绝使用大脑的某些部分。你没有停下来稍作思考，而是带着更大的视角重新审视自己所做的事情，看看它是否合理。

Overconfidence in your results can result from using only one mode of thinking. By making it a point to do some of your studying with friends, you can more easily catch where your thinking has gone astray.
对结果的过度自信可能源于只使用一种思维方式。通过和朋友一起学习，你可以更容易发现自己思维中的错误。

Taking a test is serious business, just as fighter pilots and doctors go through checklists before takeoff and surgery, going through your own test preparation checklist can vastly improve your chances of success.
考试是一项严肃的事务，就像飞行员和医生在起飞和手术前会使用检查表一样，使用自己的考试准备检查表可以大大提高成功的机会。

Counterintuitive strategies such as the hard start jump to easy technique, can give your brain a chance to reflect on harder challenges even as you're focusing on other more straightforward problems.
一些反直觉的策略，比如“先难后易”的方法，可以让你的大脑在专注于更简单的问题时，反思更困难的挑战。

Here are some last test taking pointers:

这里有一些最后的考试小贴士：

The body puts out chemicals when it's under stress. How you interpret your body's reaction to those chemicals makes all the difference. If you shift your thinking from, this test has made me afraid, to this test has got me excited to do my best, it helps improve your performance.
身体反应：当你处于压力下，身体会释放化学物质。如何解读这些反应至关重要。如果你能将思维从“这次考试让我害怕”转变为“这次考试让我兴奋去表现最好”，会有助于提高你的表现。

If you're panicked on a test, momentarily turn your attention to your breathing. Relax your stomach, place your hand on it, and slowly draw a deep breath. Your hand should move outward and your whole chest should expand like a barrel.
调节呼吸：如果在考试中感到恐慌，可以暂时将注意力转向呼吸。放松腹部，手放在上面，慢慢深吸一口气。你的手应该向外移动，整个胸部像桶一样扩张。

Your mind can trick you into thinking that what you've done is correct even if it isn't. This means that whenever possible you should blink, shift your attention, and then double check your answers using a big picture perspective, asking yourself, does this really make sense?
检查答案：你的思维可能会让你错误地认为自己的答案是正确的。因此，每当可能时，应该眨眼、转换注意力，然后用整体视角检查答案，问自己：“这真的有意义吗？”

And finally, remember that not getting enough sleep the night before a test can negate any other preparation you've done.
睡眠重要性：最后，记得前一晚没有充足的睡眠可能会抵消你所做的其他准备。

### 4.11 Wrap Up to the Course by Terrence Sejnowski and Barbara Oakley

*Dr. Sejnowski*: Welcome to the last video of Learning How to Learn. If you're still listening to us, then you've come all the way through the course. And may remember at the beginning, I said that brains do not come with an instruction manual. So we have to write one ourselves. And that was one of our goals. In this final video, we want to tell you how much we've enjoyed teaching and learning. We've learned from you as we hoped you've learned from us. The truth is you've always been in the driver's seat when it comes to your own learning. But now that you have a better feeling for what's under your neural hood, you can use this to help you learn new things all during your lifetime. *Dr. Oakley*: What we're hoping is that as the days and months will pass you'll continue to bring to mind some of the key ideas you've learned in the course. Approaches such as switching your mode of thinking from focused to diffuse can help reduce your frustration and allow for more creative problem solving. Strengthening your chunking can give you a firmer grasp of the material. Even seemingly tiny changes in your daily approach to your work. Using the pomodoro technique, for example, can make a dramatic long-term difference in your learning and in your ultimate success. *Dr. Sejnowski*: Learning is so vitally important to our future that most of us spend 12 to 16 of our earliest years of our lives in school, culminating in high school or college. But the focus in formal education is on the product of learning, not the process of learning. In this course, we've tried to give you a better sense of the learning process. Although this is our last video, we hope it's not our last chance to influence you. You have not truly learned something unless you can teach it to others. Teach those ideas to others and you will find that they will continue to resonate and deepen in your own mind. *Dr. Oakley*: We hope you'll also have discovered how powerful these ideas can be at helping you broaden your interest, passion, and expertise. Many people believe that what they're initially, sort of, naturally good at is what they're supposed to be doing in life. But I myself am living proof that passions can broaden, change, and grow. The world is evolving and a broad tool kit that allows you to learn effectively in many different subject areas is one of the most powerful assets you can have. *Dr. Sejnowski*: Best of luck in your life of learning. *Dr. Oakley*: Ditto that.
*Dr. Sejnowski*：欢迎来到《学习如何学习》的最后一段视频。如果你还在听我们，那么你已经完成了整个课程。你可能还记得，在一开始，我提到过大脑没有使用说明书。所以我们必须自己写一本。这也是我们的目标之一。在最后这个视频中，我们想告诉你们，我们多么享受教学和学习。我们从你们身上学到了很多，希望你们也从我们这里学到了东西。事实是，在你的学习过程中，你一直处于驾驶座上。现在你对大脑的工作有了更好的理解，你可以利用这些知识帮助自己在一生中学习新事物。

*Dr. Oakley*：我们希望，随着时间的推移，你能继续记住在课程中学到的一些关键理念。比如，切换你的思维模式，从集中到扩散，可以帮助减少挫折感，并允许更具创造性的解决问题。强化你的分块学习能让你对材料有更扎实的掌握。甚至在日常工作中进行一些看似微小的变化，例如使用番茄工作法，都能对你的学习和最终的成功产生显著的长期影响。

*Dr. Sejnowski*：学习对我们的未来至关重要，大多数人会在早期的12到16年里待在学校，最终获得高中文凭或大学学位。但正式教育的重点是学习的结果，而不是学习的过程。在这门课程中，我们试图让你更好地理解学习的过程。虽然这是我们的最后一段视频，但我们希望这不是我们影响你的最后一次机会。你只有在能够教会别人时，才算真正学会了某样东西。将这些理念教给他人，你会发现它们在你自己的脑海中不断共鸣和深化。

*Dr. Oakley*：我们也希望你发现这些理念在帮助你拓宽兴趣、热情和专业方面的强大力量。许多人认为，自己最初的天赋就是他们应该做的事情。但我本人就是一个活生生的例子，证明热情可以拓展、改变和成长。世界在不断发展，一个能够有效学习多个学科的广泛工具箱，是你可以拥有的最强大的资产之一。

*Dr. Sejnowski*：祝你在学习的道路上一切顺利。

*Dr. Oakley*：我也同样祝福你。

### 1-1 Introduction – About Mindshift

I'm Barbara Oakley. And I'm Terry Sejnowski. Welcome to Mindshift. We created the MOOC: Learning How to Learn which to our surprise became the world's largest and most popular MOOC, to give you the specifics about how to learn more effectively. In this MOOC, we're going to grow things even bigger, so you can learn not only more effectively but more broadly. In other words, we will help you to develop a learning lifestyle. Who you are today, is not the same person who went to sleep last night. We now know, that your experiences during the day are integrated into your brain circuits while you are asleep. So, that you wake up in the morning, your brain is updated.
我是芭芭拉·奥克利。我是特里·塞诺夫斯基。欢迎来到《思维转变》。我们创建了慕课课程《学习如何学习》，令我们惊讶的是，它成为了全球最大、最受欢迎的慕课，旨在为您提供更有效学习的具体方法。在这个慕课中，我们将进一步拓展，让您不仅能更有效地学习，还能更广泛地学习。换句话说，我们将帮助您培养一种学习的生活方式。您今天的自己，已经不同于昨晚入睡时的自己。我们现在知道，白天的经历会在您睡觉时整合进大脑回路。所以，当您早晨醒来时，大脑已经得到了更新。

You can take advantage of this to become a different person than you were last week, or last month, or last year because you brain is different and you can guide the process. To begin with, I'm going to tell you about one of the worst things that's ever happened to me. Something that cause one of my biggest most embarrassing failures. . Yes, everybody, including me, has failures and false starts. Now, you may know that I basically flunked my way through elementary, middle and High school Math and Science. When I was young, the only thing I thought I could do. The only thing I was interested in was trying to learn a new language. Any new language since all I spoke was English. If you speak English as an additional language you are so lucky. So, that's why I enlisted in the army right out of High school, because the military would actually pay me to learn a new language. Although, I wasn't of Russian heritage, I decided to learn Russian, and I did learn Russian. The army even gave me a scholarship, and I got my first degree, a bachelors degree in slavic languages and literature. I was all set, as a language expert I expected to go into military intelligence. To use my skills, that was pretty much the only place my new language skills could be used.
您可以利用这一点，让自己变得与上周、上个月甚至去年的自己不同，因为您的大脑已经有所不同，您可以引导这一过程。首先，我想告诉您我经历过的最糟糕的一件事。那是导致我一次最大、最尴尬失败的事情。是的，每个人，包括我自己，都经历过失败和不顺利的开端。您可能知道，我基本上在小学、初中和高中的数学和科学课程中一路挂科。小时候，我唯一认为自己能做的、唯一感兴趣的就是学习一门新语言。任何一种新语言，因为我只会说英语。如果您把英语作为一门额外的语言来学，您真的很幸运。这就是为什么我高中毕业后直接参军，因为军队会支付我学习一门新语言的费用。尽管我并不是俄裔，但我决定学习俄语，而且我确实学会了俄语。军队甚至还给了我一份奖学金，我获得了第一个学位——斯拉夫语言文学的学士学位。我万事俱备，作为一名语言专家，我希望进入军事情报部门，运用我的技能，因为那几乎是唯一可以用到我新语言技能的地方。

Didn't happen, it like. Really didn't happen, they only put me into the signal corps. That meant, that I would be responsible for all sorts of electrical communication systems. From cables, and telephones, to advanced electrical switching systems. I was horrified. And it wasn't like I was some kind of brilliant, intellectual superstar who turned it all around and charged ahead to immediately excel anyway. In fact, I graduated last in my class in signal officer training school. I didn't even know what a volt was, much less than how a telephone worked. Here I was stalking a field I hated, doing a job I couldn't really understand. I was so terrible at my job, that we all eventually agreed that I should move into something far less technical. Those four years as a military officer were very difficult. I was lonely, stationed thousands of miles from my home and family. And well, I was a failure. What's funny about this, is that it's actually one of the best things that's ever happened to me.
事情并没有如我所愿，真的完全没有如我所愿。他们只把我分配到了信号兵部队。这意味着我要负责各种电气通信系统，从电缆和电话到先进的电气交换系统。我当时非常害怕。而且我并不是那种能够迅速改变现状、马上表现出色的聪明人。事实上，我在信号官训练学校里是全班最后一名毕业的。我甚至不知道伏特是什么，更不用说电话是如何工作的了。我就这样陷入了一个我讨厌的领域，做着一份我根本无法理解的工作。我在这份工作上表现得太糟糕了，以至于我们最终一致认为我应该转到技术性较低的岗位上去。这四年的军官生活非常艰难，我很孤独，被派驻在离家和家人几千英里的地方。而且，说实话，我是个失败者。可笑的是，这竟然成为我生命中最好的经历之一。

Believe it or not, I'm now a professor of engineering and I love my job. In this MOOC, we're going to talk about what I learned on the path to my change in thinking, my mind shift. We're going to talk not only about some of the changes I've experienced. And inspirational and insightful stories of other people's growth and change. But, we're also going to be exploring what science is telling us about how we can change.
信不信由你，我现在是一名工程学教授，而且我非常热爱这份工作。在这门慕课中，我们将讨论我在思维转变的过程中学到的东西，我的心态转变。不仅会谈到我自己经历的一些变化，还会分享其他人在成长和改变中的一些鼓舞人心且富有见解的故事。同时，我们还将探讨科学告诉我们的关于如何改变的知识。

This course is about how you can do and be much more than you ever might think. It's about how you can grow from failure to success. It's about how you can broaden your horizons and be more than you ever thought you could be, no matter what your age, or your past. It's about how you'll feel better and be healthier because of a learning lifestyle. And, it's about how to look around you, at what you're learning, in your place, in what's unfolding in the society around you. So you can be what you want to be, given the real world constraints that life puts on us all. No, this isn't a course based on magic, where we promise to somehow turn you into a genius and make all your wishes for learning and careers come true. But you'll see, that by using certain mental tricks and insights you can often learn more and do more. Far more than you might have ever dreamed, we'll talk about what science tells us about how we learn and change. We'll build on what you already know to take your life's learning fantastic new directions. You might think, well, I've taken aptitude tests. The experts are telling me what I should be doing. And besides, I can feel inside what I'm good at.
这门课程是关于如何超越自我，成就远超您想象的更多可能。它会告诉您如何从失败走向成功，如何开阔视野，超越自我，无论年龄或过去如何。课程将帮助您通过一种学习的生活方式获得更好的状态和更健康的生活。同时，它也会引导您观察周围、观察您在所在位置学到的东西，观察在您身边的社会中正在发生的事。这样，您就可以在现实生活的各种限制下，实现自己想要的目标。不，这不是一门基于魔法的课程，我们不会承诺让您变成天才，或让所有学习和职业的愿望都实现。但您会发现，通过使用某些心智技巧和洞察力，您往往可以学得更多、做得更多，远超出您曾经的梦想。我们将讨论科学告诉我们的关于学习和改变的知识，并基于您已有的知识，将您的学习带向令人激动的新方向。您可能会想：“我已经做过能力测试了，专家告诉我该做什么。况且，我也能感觉到自己擅长什么。”

But remember, all those aptitude tests and internal feelings are just reflections of what you're good at right now. They don't give you a clue about how you can shift and shifting your thinking, mind shift is what this course is all about. Are you ready? Lets get started.
但请记住，所有这些能力测试和内心的感觉只是对您当前擅长事物的反映。它们并不能告诉您如何实现转变，而思维的转变正是这门课程的核心。您准备好了吗？让我们开始吧。



### 1-2 The Value of Being a Slow Learner

Have you ever watched as the teacher would ask a question in class and then before you could even understand what the question was about, some student already had their hand in the air with the answer? Some people just plain seem to have race car brains. They get to the finish line, they answer really, really fast. Other people like me have what you might call hiker brains. They get to the finish line but because they're walking, they get there much, much more slowly. With the race car driver, they do get to the finish line a lot faster, but everything goes by in a rush.  They're also on a set, smooth roadway. They know exactly where they're going. A hiker on the other hand, moves slowly. But while they're hiking, they can reach out. They can touch the leaves on the trees, smell the air, hear the birds. And they can easily veer off the expected path into places where people don't normally go.
您是否曾在课堂上看到老师提问时，自己还没理解问题，有的同学就已经举手回答了？有些人似乎天生拥有“赛车”般的大脑，他们迅速到达终点，回答得非常快。而像我这样的人，大脑更像是“徒步者”。我们也能到达终点，但因为我们走得慢，速度会慢得多。赛车手确实会更快到达终点，但一切都飞速掠过，而且他们行驶在一条平坦的道路上，知道自己要去哪里。而徒步者则缓慢前行，但在路上，他们可以伸手触摸树叶，闻到空气的气息，听到鸟鸣。他们还可以轻易偏离预定的路径，进入其他人通常不会走的地方。

The race car brain and the hiker brain, in other words have two completely different experiences. And even though the hiker brain may move much more slowly sometimes, because of how it works it can see more deeply. My hero in science is a man named Santiago Ramon y Cajal. Ramon y Cajal won the Nobel Prize in 1906, for his pioneering work in helping us understand the structure of the nervous system. Ramon y Cajal is considered the father of modern neuroscience. But here is where it gets really interesting, Ramon y Cajal was not a genius. He said so himself and he wasn't just being humble. However, Ramon y Cajal worked with geniuses. He found they often shared similar problems. For example, these geniuses with their race car brains  were used to jumping ahead to speedy conclusions. And when they were incorrect, they weren't use to changing their minds. So they keep charging ahead with the incorrect conclusion they jumped to, their super fast brains could easily devise justification. Because they weren't really looking to prove themselves wrong. Ramon y Cajal himself though had a persistent hiker type brain. He'd come up with a hypothesis and then he'd persistently check it out in a way that would reveal whether he was wrong. Instead of just trying to prove that he was right. If he was wrong, he changed his mind and flexibly try again. So was his persistence and his flexibility in the face of what the data was truly telling him that made him superstar researcher. It wasn't his genius. This kind of phenomena is seen in many different fields. For example, super smart people don't make very good hostage negotiators. Why? Because they go into the hostage situation with their own preconceived notions, which are sometimes dead wrong. And then when critical information does reveal itself, they can't flexibly change their mind and take advantage of that information. So if you have a race car brain just be aware, one of your biggest assets can become your biggest liability if you get too used to thinking you're always right, and that you're the smartest person around. And if you have a hiker type brain rejoice, there's much for you to contribute in the world with your slow, sometimes very unexpected way of approaching things.
换句话说，“赛车”型大脑和“徒步”型大脑会经历完全不同的体验。尽管徒步型大脑有时可能移动得更慢，但由于其运作方式，它能够看到更深层的内容。我的科学偶像是一位名叫圣地亚哥·拉蒙-卡哈尔的人。拉蒙-卡哈尔因其在帮助我们理解神经系统结构方面的开创性工作，于1906年获得了诺贝尔奖。他被誉为现代神经科学之父。但有趣的是，拉蒙-卡哈尔并不是天才，他自己也这么说过，而且这不是谦虚之词。然而，拉蒙-卡哈尔曾与许多天才共事，他发现他们往往有一些相似的问题。例如，这些拥有“赛车”型大脑的天才习惯于快速得出结论，而当他们的结论不正确时，他们往往不愿改变自己的想法，于是继续沿着错误的结论前进。凭借他们的快速思维，他们很容易为错误找到合理的解释，因为他们并不是在真正寻找证明自己错误的证据。

然而，拉蒙-卡哈尔本人的大脑则是坚持不懈的徒步型。他提出一个假设，然后执着地验证它是否正确，而不仅仅是想证明自己是对的。如果发现自己错了，他会改变想法，灵活地重新尝试。正是这种坚持和面对数据的灵活性使他成为杰出的研究者，而非他的天才。类似的现象在许多领域都可以看到。例如，超级聪明的人并不是很好的人质谈判专家。为什么呢？因为他们带着固有的成见进入人质谈判，有时这些成见完全错误。当关键信息出现时，他们无法灵活地改变主意，从而错失利用这些信息的机会。

所以，如果您有“赛车”型大脑，请注意，当您过于习惯认为自己总是对的、是最聪明的那个人时，您的最大优势可能会成为最大的劣势。而如果您有徒步型大脑，请庆幸，您在这个世界上可以用您缓慢、有时非常出人意料的方式做出许多贡献。



### 1-3 From Passive to Active

The Fengjia Night Market in Taichung, Taiwan is really famous. They have just about everything you could imagine. One evening, you could have also found me there. I ended up at the stall that sold something called stinky tofu. I mean, stinky tofu is really stinky. The reality is, though, it tastes pretty good, kind of like a strong cheese. The thing is, you watching me tell you about stinky tofu is very different from you actually going to the famed Fengjia night market yourself and tasting stinky tofu. It's only when you actively do something yourself that you're learning really sticks. Trust me, I'll never forget about stinky tofu. You might think that taking an active approach to learning is totally obvious. But not only do students often not get this. Even professional teachers and professors themselves often don't get this, although it goes right to the heart of how we can most effectively learn and change. It's easy even for someone like me who knows better to sometimes take the easier path and avoid being active in what I'm trying to learn. Active learning applies to any kind of learning, whether it's learning about stinky tofu, leaning how to speak French, or learning to play the piano. It also applies to learning in math and science. This paper right here gathered together the results of some 200 studies on active learning in science, technology, engineering, and math programs. Turns out that one in three people drop out of these kinds of courses if they are taught in the traditional way with the professor droning away in the front of the classroom. But only one in five students drops from their course if it's taught with a professor using active learning, where the students get to actively work the problems themselves. In other words, the best teachers build breaks into their lectures so that students can actively work with the materials. Now, if you're a professor or teacher, and you think well, there's just no time for this just remember that speaking fast and covering a lot of material doesn't mean that the students are actually learning the material. There are guidelines that can help you cover the material even while your students are actively learning in your classroom.
台湾台中的逢甲夜市非常有名，几乎可以找到你能想象的一切。有一天晚上，你还会在那里找到我。我最终停在了一个卖“臭豆腐”的摊位前。臭豆腐的味道真的是很臭，不过实际上味道不错，有点像浓郁的奶酪。但关键是，你看我讲臭豆腐和你自己亲自去逢甲夜市尝臭豆腐的体验是完全不同的。只有当你亲身去体验时，学习才会真正深入人心。相信我，我永远不会忘记臭豆腐的味道。

您可能认为主动学习的方式显而易见，但实际上，学生往往没有意识到这一点。甚至很多专业的老师和教授也没有意识到，尽管这正是我们有效学习和改变的核心。即使是像我这样明白主动学习重要性的人，有时也会选择轻松的路径，避免主动参与学习。主动学习适用于任何学习，无论是了解臭豆腐，学习法语，还是学钢琴，也适用于数学和科学学习。

这里有一篇论文，汇集了约200项关于科学、技术、工程和数学项目中主动学习的研究结果。结果显示，如果用传统的教学方法，即教授在课堂前单调讲授内容，那么大约有三分之一的学生会退出这类课程。而如果教授使用主动学习的方法，让学生自己动手解决问题，那么仅有五分之一的学生会退课。换句话说，最好的教师会在讲课中设置间隙，让学生主动参与到材料的学习中。

如果您是教授或老师，觉得没有时间这样做，请记住：说得快、覆盖内容多并不代表学生真的学会了这些内容。课堂上有一些指导方针可以帮助您在确保学生主动学习的同时，顺利完成课程内容的讲授。

I once had a student who was flunking my engineering statistics class. When I questioned him about it, he said it was because his English was bad. He spoke English as an additional language. But actually his English was great. It turned out that he just wasn't taking the time to actively work through the problems himself. He was fooling himself. Looking at worked out solutions right in front of him and thinking he knew how to solve them himself. He also wasn't working actively with his team. Once we corrected that problem, and he started working actively with the problems himself, checking them with others, he began to do much better. As one of the artists for this MOOC told me, only watching tutorials and avoiding the actual practice is a big problem with art students who are trying to teach themselves. As another example, let's look at how I helped to construct the MOOC, Learning How to Learn. I'd never done any camera work or editing before. I watched YouTube clips to learn how to edit videos and that helped me to get started. But it was only when I started actively editing videos myself in conjunction with watching the YouTube instructions, that it really began to stick. One trick I've learned as a teacher is to deliberately put my hands behind my back when I'm trying to show something to students. It helps keep me from reaching out and doing whatever I'm trying to ask the student to do. For example, it's always tempting for me to write an equation or adjust the setting myself, because I already know it, and I can do it much more quickly. I even do this hands-behind-the-back technique as a mom and as a grandma. So as a learner, if someone tries to show you by writing or doing it themselves, try to gently push them away so that you are doing it. More generally do your best to take charge of whatever you're learning about to put a pen or pencil to paper to take quizzes, to do assignments, get your hands on it. So you can actively master the material yourself. Be an active group member in collaborative testing or any group project or assignment. In other words, test, test, test yourself all the time on anything you really want to learn. If the book's just open there in front of you or the video is just played right before you, you think you know it, but you don't. Only when you close the book or turn away from the video and test yourself by seeing if you can do it yourself, do you really know that you know it. Now, here comes the fade to white, you know what's coming.
我曾经有一个学生在我的工程统计课上挂科了。当我问他原因时，他说是因为他的英语不好，因为他把英语作为一门额外的语言来学。但实际上他的英语非常好。问题在于他没有花时间亲自去做题目，而是在自欺欺人。看着面前的解题步骤，觉得自己已经掌握了如何解题，但其实并没有。他也没有积极参与到小组合作中。纠正了这个问题后，他开始自己主动做题，与其他人一起检查，成绩就逐渐提高了。

这门慕课的一位艺术家告诉我，只看教程而不实际练习是艺术自学学生的一个大问题。另一个例子是，当我参与构建《学习如何学习》这门慕课时，我从未接触过摄像或剪辑工作。为了学习剪辑视频，我看了很多YouTube教程，这帮助我入了门。但只有当我在看YouTube教程的同时，自己动手实际剪辑视频时，技能才真正开始巩固。

作为教师，我学到的一个小技巧是，当我给学生展示某些东西时，会故意把手放在背后，这样我就不会情不自禁地亲自动手。比如，我总是很想自己去写一个方程或调整设置，因为我已经知道怎么做，而且可以更快完成。我甚至在当妈妈和奶奶时也使用这个“手放在背后”的方法。所以，作为学习者，如果有人想通过写或自己动手来示范，试着轻轻推开他们，让自己来动手。

更广泛地说，尽量掌控您所学的内容，动手写写画画，做测验，完成作业，亲自实践，以便自己主动掌握这些知识。在协作测试或任何小组项目或任务中，积极参与。在任何您真正想学的东西上，不断测试自己。如果书本打开在面前或视频播放在您眼前，您可能会觉得自己已经掌握了，但实际上并没有。只有当您合上书或背对视频，测试自己能否独立完成，您才真正知道自己掌握了。

现在画面慢慢变白了，您知道接下来会发生什么。

Okay, that in video quiz question was totally easy. But we put it there just because it helps reinforce a vital point and start an effective study habit in this MOOC. Actually, good quiz questions can be super helpful for tamping down your knowledge, which is why it helps to take quizzes. If you have one hour of studying versus one hour of taking a test, you'll actually learn far more when taking the test, even if you don't get the answers to the test, and even if you fail the test and don't know the answers. Well, at least then you know exactly what questions you want to find the answers to the next time you sit down to study. You can't actively do everything in every course all the time. From time to time, all of us especially me  are distracted by our wandering minds.  But the more you make use of active learning about the key aspects of a material, the better your ability to change your thinking to make a MindShift. It can take more effort to learn actively, so do not be surprised if your brain sometimes finds excuses to shy away from active learning. Incidentally, working with others is another way of grappling actively with the material, so that's why it can be so helpful to interact on the discussion forms. In fact, talking with others is probably more pleasant than any other kind of active learning. Anyway, all of this is what is really important for you to actively work through the exercises we're suggesting. And sometimes to interact with others to get the most out of this course, or to get the most of any subject you're trying to master. Incidentally, MOOCs like this one can be better than just watching a television show about what you're trying to learn. That's because MOOCs give you the opportunity to actively practice with the material, and interact with others, as well as just listen to your professor. So remember, in this course, and every subject or area where you really want to master the material, keep yourself working actively. I'm Barbara Oakley. Happy MindShift.
好吧，视频中的测验题确实非常简单。但我们之所以设置它，是因为它有助于强化一个重要的点，同时在这门慕课中培养有效的学习习惯。实际上，好的测验题可以帮助巩固知识，因此参与测验是有益的。如果你有一小时的学习时间和一小时的测验时间，那么即便没有测试答案，甚至没有通过考试，只要去参加测试，你学到的内容实际上会更多。至少，你会清楚下次学习时应该找到哪些问题的答案。

当然，不可能在每门课上时时刻刻都保持积极学习。我们所有人，尤其是我，有时会被自己的思绪分散注意力。但是越多地在学习材料的关键部分运用主动学习，你就越能改变思维，实现思维转变。主动学习确实需要更多努力，因此如果你的大脑有时找借口回避，不要感到意外。

顺便提一下，与他人一起学习也是主动学习的一种方式，这就是为什么在讨论区互动会非常有帮助。事实上，与他人交流可能是最愉快的主动学习方式。总之，重要的是要认真完成我们提供的练习，有时通过互动来充分利用这门课程，或是你试图掌握的任何学科内容。

顺便说一句，像这门慕课就比只看关于学习内容的电视节目更有效。因为慕课不仅可以让你听教授讲解，还能让你主动练习所学内容，并与他人互动。因此，请记住，在这门课程或任何你真正想要掌握的领域中，始终保持主动学习。我是芭芭拉·奥克利。祝你思维转变愉快！



### 1-4 The Value of Your Past

Thomas Kuhn was a detective. He wasn't your ordinary detective. For one thing, he'd gotten his doctorate in physics from Harvard University. For another, after he'd gotten his doctorate, he'd done a major mind shift and morphed to become a historian of science. He held professorships at the University of California, Berkeley, then at Princeton, and finally at MIT. Kuhn was interested in the process of how science unfolds. Is it just a steady accumulation of bits and pieces that gradually build our understanding of the real world? Or, is it more punctuated? A breakthrough here, a breakthrough there? Interestingly, Kuhn found there's a lot of what's called normal science. Normal science takes an idea or approach and fleshes it out to build our knowledge base. Normal science is like pottering along with Isaac Newton's theories about how the universe works. Or with the idea that stress causes gastric ulcers. An idea that virtually every scientist working in the field took for granted. But every once in a while, what can be called a paradigm shift happens. Basically someone takes the same information that everyone else sees, sort of like seeing a duck. See the beak right here? And they interpret it, they see it in a completely different way. They suddenly see, for example, that the duck can also be a rabbit. See how the rabbit ears point upwards?
托马斯·库恩是一位侦探。他并不是普通的侦探。首先，他从哈佛大学获得了物理学博士学位。其次，在拿到博士学位后，他进行了一个重大的思维转变，转而成为科学史学家。他先后在加州大学伯克利分校、普林斯顿大学和麻省理工学院担任教授。

库恩对科学的发展过程非常感兴趣。科学是否只是零碎知识的稳步积累，从而逐渐构建我们对现实世界的理解？或者，这一过程是更具间断性的？这里一个突破，那里一个突破？有趣的是，库恩发现科学中存在大量的“常规科学”。常规科学采用一种想法或方法，扩展细化，构建我们的知识体系。常规科学就像是沿用艾萨克·牛顿关于宇宙如何运行的理论，或者认为压力导致胃溃疡的观点——这是几乎所有该领域的科学家都视为理所当然的观点。

但偶尔会发生所谓的“范式转变”。基本上，有人用与他人相同的信息，却得出完全不同的解读，有点像看到一只鸭子。看到鸭子的喙了吗？他们从完全不同的角度解读这些信息，突然间发现，这只鸭子也可以是一只兔子。看看兔子的耳朵，是不是向上竖着？

So as science unfolds, there are periods of normal science. Expanding the knowledge base using normal methodology. Physicists might use Newton's laws to calculate the motion of the planets. Scientists might work to have a better understanding of the acidic environment of the stomach. Knowledge expands out in the usual way as scientists do their work. But, as science is marching placidly along someone comes along who's able to see things in a brand new way. A paradigm shift. For example, Einstein was able to see through the usual Newtonian physics, to view the universe in a different, more relativistic way. And Nobel Prize winner Barry Marshall famously gave himself an ulcer, along with some very bad breath, by drinking a concoction of the bacteria Helicobacter pylori. So that he could convince his critics that it was bacteria, not stress, that was the primary cause of ulcers. So indeed, the scientific process unfolds with punctuations. Periods of normal science that are then interrupted by a paradigm shift which shapes how normal science continues to unfold, until the next paradigm shift. And so on. Paradigm shifts allow us to have enormous new gains in our creative understanding of the world. So what kind of people make paradigm shifts? Those kinds of mind shifts that allowed them to see the world around them in new ways? Kuhn found that there were two types of mind shifters. One type was young people, people who hadn't yet been indoctrinated into seeing the world in the same way that everybody else did. With their youthful eyes, they can see with fresh perspectives. Now, if you don't qualify as a young person, you're probably thinking, that knocks me out then! I'm not in my teens or 20s, so no breakthroughs for me. But hang on. There was a second group of people. People who were older but who were just as innovative as those young people. These were people who had switched disciplines or careers. It was the change in focus, the career switch, that allowed the second older group to see with fresh eyes. Often, it allowed them to bring their seemingly unrelated prior knowledge to the table in new ways that helped them to innovate. These insights from science can also help us understand creativity and innovation in our everyday lives and careers. Let's take me. In my late teens and early 20s, I learned Russian. Then in my late 20s, I decided to start learning math and science. You might think that my time spent learning Russian was a waste. It wouldn't help once I switched my focus to engineering. But that's actually not at all true. Learning Russian gave me a lot of the insight about the learning process more generally. And I found that learning insight that I'd gained, transferred to help me be better in learning math and science. The same repetition, deliberate practice on the hard stuff, and flexible interleaving that helped me to successfully learn Russian and helped me to be successful when I started to begin to learn math and science. We see this phenomenon constantly in many fields. A background in sports can come in handy in a marketing career. Insights from a former career as an event planner can help you be a better software programmer. A hobby playing action-style video games can actually sharpen your mind and even your eyesight. Head towards the discussion forum after this video and tell others about the unexpected assets you've brought into your work from your past seemingly unconnected knowledge. Feel free to also tell others how you've broken through initial feelings of incompetence on your way to learning something new. As you post your own thoughts, you'll be surprised to find the fantastic and inspirational stories of others. Old or young, you may feel like you have a childlike incompetence when you're learning something new or you're changing disciplines or careers. This is very typical. But keep in mind that the feelings of incompetence will gradually pass. The creative power that you can bring to the table because of your willingness to change can be invaluable. It might even lead you to start a paradigm shift of your own.
随着科学的发展，会经历一段段的常规科学时期，通过常规方法扩展知识基础。物理学家可能会用牛顿定律来计算行星的运动，科学家可能会更深入地了解胃酸环境。知识按照通常的方式扩展，科学家们各司其职。然而，当科学平稳前进时，有人会以全新的方式看待事物，从而带来范式转变。例如，爱因斯坦超越了传统的牛顿物理学，以不同、更具相对性的视角观察宇宙。诺贝尔奖得主巴里·马歇尔则通过饮用幽门螺杆菌混合物给自己制造了胃溃疡并引发口臭，最终说服批评者相信溃疡的主要原因是细菌而非压力。

因此，科学的进展确实是间歇式的：一段常规科学时期后，范式转变随之而来，塑造了常规科学继续发展的方向，直到下一个范式转变出现。范式转变让我们在理解世界的创造力上获得巨大的进展。那么，究竟是什么样的人才会实现范式转变？库恩发现，有两类人会发生这种思维转变。第一类是年轻人，他们尚未被灌输固定的世界观，因此能以崭新的视角看待事物。如果您不属于年轻人，可能会想，那我没机会了！我已经不是青少年或二十多岁的人了，看来突破与我无缘。但别急，库恩还发现了第二类人，即那些年长但同样创新的人，他们是那些转换过学科或职业的人。正是这种焦点的转变、职业的切换，赋予了第二类年长者以全新的视角，使他们能够以新的方式将之前看似无关的知识运用到新的领域，帮助他们创新。

这些科学上的洞见也能帮助我们理解日常生活和职业中的创造力与创新。就以我为例。二十岁左右时我学习俄语，二十七八岁时决定开始学习数学和科学。您可能会认为学习俄语的时间浪费了，毕竟我转向工程后，俄语似乎毫无帮助。但事实上，俄语学习让我对学习过程有了更深的理解。我发现，这种学习洞见让我在学习数学和科学时也更为成功。学习俄语时用到的重复、对难题的刻意练习以及灵活的交错学习法，帮助我成功掌握了俄语，也同样帮助我在学习数学和科学时取得成功。

我们在很多领域都能看到这种现象。体育背景可能对营销事业有所帮助，前活动策划的经验可以让你成为更出色的软件程序员。玩动作类电子游戏的爱好甚至可以提高思维敏捷度和视力。在本视频结束后，前往讨论区，与他人分享您从过去看似无关的知识中带到工作的意外收获。也可以分享您如何克服最初的无力感，逐步学习新事物的经历。当您发表自己的想法时，会惊讶地发现其他人那些精彩且激励人心的故事。无论是年轻人还是年长者，在学习新东西、转换学科或职业时，都可能会感觉自己像孩子一样无力，这是很正常的。但请记住，这种无力感会逐渐消退。正因为您愿意改变，这种创造力将无比宝贵，甚至可能引领您发起自己的范式转变。



### 1-5 Mastery Learning

I started to try to take physics in my Senior year of high school, but I was flunking so badly, they finally took me out of the class. I stayed away from science and math as much as I possibly could. Why would I punish myself by trying to study subjects I obviously had no talent for? Of course, the fact that I'm now a professor of engineering tells you I was dead wrong about what I could develop a talent for. Some people do find some subjects easier to learn than others. But say, if your brother seems naturally smarter than you at math, this doesn't mean you can't learn the subject yourself. In fact, you may actually sometimes be even more creative than your brother with math, because you're using a different set of neural circuits than he is. When we go through school, we tend to focus on areas that we're thought to be good at. If we happen to find math easy and English more difficult, for example, we'll tend to take more math courses, if we can, and take fewer English courses. After all, taking English could hurt our grade point average. And if we're better at English, and not so good at math, we'll focus on English courses and skip the math. This means we tend to get more practice at what we're already kind of good at, so we get even better at it. But the flip side is, we don't get as much practice in other areas and so we tend to lag behind in them. And if we do go to college, where we have to pick a major, this tendency is sharpened even further. All this relates to a concept called mastery learning. In old-fashioned instruction, the kind you've probably experienced in school, all the students in a class are given the same amount of instruction time to learn the material. In mastery learning, on the other hand, it's understood that different students may need different amounts of instruction time and different amounts of practice in order to master the material, even though they all eventually do master the material. In fact, research is showing the value of mastery learning, where you can retake quiz variants over and over again, until you feel comfortable with the material. You can re-watch lectures if you need to, or even get different explanations of the material. This approach, as researchers are discovering, is one of the best methods for helping people to gain expertise, even with material they never thought they could learn before. There's all sorts of evidence of how, once you begin practicing in some area, your brain starts to develop the new neural architecture that supports your learning. I once met a taxi driver in London who'd been a complete failure in high school. But he'd spent several years studying for the London taxi driver's examination, which is a very intense test where thousands of different routes must be internalized.
我高中的最后一年曾试图学习物理，但成绩差得离谱，最终被迫退课。从那之后，我尽可能远离科学和数学。毕竟，为什么要去惩罚自己，尝试学习那些显然没有天赋的科目呢？当然，现在我是工程学教授，这也说明我对自己的潜力判断完全错了。有些人确实发现某些学科更容易学，但假如您的哥哥似乎在数学上天生比您聪明，这并不意味着您自己不能学好数学。事实上，您在数学上可能会比您的哥哥更有创造力，因为您使用的是不同的一组神经回路。

在学校，我们往往专注于自己被认为擅长的领域。例如，如果我们觉得数学简单而英语更难，我们会倾向于多选数学课，尽量少选英语课，毕竟，选英语可能会影响我们的平均成绩。而如果我们更擅长英语，不太擅长数学，就会集中选英语课，避开数学课。这意味着我们在已经有点擅长的领域获得更多练习机会，从而更加精通。然而，另一面是，我们在其他领域的练习较少，因此在这些领域往往会落后。如果我们上了大学，还要选择专业，这种趋势会进一步加剧。

这与一个叫做“掌握性学习”的概念有关。在传统的教学中，所有学生在同样的时间内接受相同的课程。而在掌握性学习中，不同的学生可能需要不同的学习时间和练习量来掌握知识，尽管最终他们都能掌握学习内容。研究表明，掌握性学习的价值显著，学生可以反复进行测验，直到对材料有信心为止；可以在需要时重看讲座，或获得不同的解释。研究人员发现，这种方法是帮助人们掌握专业知识的最佳方法之一，甚至包括他们原本认为无法学会的内容。

各种证据表明，一旦开始在某个领域进行练习，大脑就会开始构建新的神经结构来支持学习。我曾在伦敦遇到一位出租车司机，他在高中时完全失败，但却花了几年时间备考伦敦出租车司机考试，这是一项非常严格的考试，需要内化成千上万条不同的路线。

After he passed, he began realizing that his brain seemed different. He could focus and concentrate more effectively. And indeed, research has shown that by studying for the London taxi driver test and then actually practicing his spatial abilities as a driver, this fellow was able to fundamentally change his brain, increasing the size of his hippocampus, an important area in learning. What's great is that these new forms of online learning, such as MOOCs like this one, allow for mastery learning. In fact, you can actually even flunk classes completely and still turn out to be a successful learner. Pat Bowden, for example, is a retired bank officer from Queensland, Australia. Her husband mentioned MOOC-taking as a hobby for her retirement. Pat saw it as a chance to learn about and master subjects she hadn't been able to study when she was younger. I've always been interested in astronomy, so I decided to do an astronomy MOOC. Soon we were into forces, gravity, and sending rockets to Mars. By week two, I was lost. I hadn't done any physics for 40 years and failed the course. But it didn't stop me. Instead of complex calculations, I let the heavy physics flow right past as I chose which videos to watch purely for interest.
通过考试后，他开始意识到自己的大脑似乎有所不同。他能够更有效地集中注意力和专注。研究确实显示，通过备考伦敦出租车司机考试并在实际驾驶中锻炼空间能力，这位司机能够从根本上改变自己的大脑，扩大了学习中重要的大脑区域——海马体的大小。

令人欣喜的是，这些新的在线学习形式，比如这门慕课，可以实现掌握性学习。实际上，即使完全挂科，仍然可以成为成功的学习者。例如，帕特·鲍登是一位来自澳大利亚昆士兰的退休银行职员。她的丈夫提议慕课作为她退休后的一个兴趣爱好。帕特则把它看作学习和掌握自己年轻时无法学习的学科的机会。

“我一直对天文学感兴趣，所以我决定选修一门天文学慕课。很快我们就进入了力学、重力以及火箭发射到火星的内容。第二周我就迷失了，因为我已经40年没有学过物理，最终挂科了。但这并没有让我止步。我跳过了复杂的计算，让艰深的物理内容略过，挑选自己感兴趣的视频观看。”

It was enlightening to realize I didn't have to pass the course. I could still learn something from it.
意识到自己不一定要通过课程，也能学到东西，这种领悟让我受益匪浅。

Later I tried another astronomy course, and then another, and yes, finally I passed. Sometimes, I take a MOOC more than once to consolidate my knowledge. Completing a course is very fulfilling, but no one else needs to know if you give up on one.
后来我尝试了另一门天文学课程，然后再尝试了一门，最终，我通过了。有时我会多次参加同一门慕课来巩固知识。完成一门课程让人很有成就感，但如果选择放弃，没有人会知道。做笔记真的帮助我更好地理解课程内容并收获更多。

Taking notes really helps me understand and get more out of a course. So far, I've completed 71 MOOCs, and failed or not finished about 15 more. And Do Edmond Sanou is a third-year statistics student from Burkina Faso. Online classes are both interesting and relaxing. I choose when I want to take classes. I can also replay videos until I understand the key ideas. I can't do that with my teachers in a regular class. Online is the best way I found to learn new skills. Overall, then, it helps to remember that any kind of learning is a little bit like learning to drive a car. You may not have the abilities of Ayrton Senna, the brilliant Brazilian race car driver who, after a lot of practice, became one of the greatest Formula One drivers of all time. But that certainly doesn't mean that you can't or shouldn't learn to drive if you have the opportunity. Some people may take longer to learn to drive than others. But most people, including me, can learn to drive.
截至目前，我已经完成了71门慕课，还有大约15门挂科或未完成。而埃德蒙·萨努是一位来自布基纳法索的大三统计学学生。他表示：“在线课程既有趣又放松。我可以选择何时上课，还能反复播放视频，直到我理解关键内容。这是在普通课堂上无法做到的。在线学习是我发现的最佳新技能学习方式。”
总的来说，记住任何学习都像学习开车有帮助。您可能没有像巴西赛车手艾尔顿·塞纳那样的天赋，经过大量练习，他成为了有史以来最伟大的一级方程式赛车手之一。但这绝不意味着，如果有机会，您不能或不应该学习驾驶。一些人可能比其他人花更长时间学习驾驶，但大多数人，包括我在内，都可以学会驾驶。

And you can use those driving skills to drive to some wonderful places. Learning is for everyone, and online learning makes some of the best approaches to learning, like mastery learning, much easier.
您可以利用这些驾驶技能去往美好的地方。学习适合每一个人，而在线学习使得最佳的学习方法，例如掌握性学习，变得更为便捷。



### 1-6 Focused Versus Diffuse – Furthering Your Understanding

In our previous MOOC, Learning How to Learn, we described the two very different modes of operation of the brain, focused and diffuse. Focused, if you'll remember, is when you're concentrating. Diffuse is when you're not thinking about anything at all in particular. We used a pinball machine metaphor to explain these two different modes. In the focused mode, the rubber bumpers of the brain were closer together, while in the diffuse mode, they were farther apart. Your thoughts could bounce further, by analogy, this is why when you're focusing hard on a problem, you sometimes get stuck within the tight spaces of the bumpers. And you can't see another, better way to approach the problem.
在我们之前的慕课《学习如何学习》中，我们描述了大脑的两种截然不同的运作模式——专注模式和发散模式。还记得，专注模式是指当您集中注意力时的状态，而发散模式则是当您没有特别去思考任何事时的状态。我们用弹球机的比喻来解释这两种模式。在专注模式下，大脑的橡胶挡板距离较近，而在发散模式下，挡板距离较远。您的思维可以更远地跳跃。正因如此，当您专注于一个问题时，有时会被挡板之间的狭窄空间困住，从而无法找到另一种更好的解决方法。

We also described the importance of developing a library of neural chunks. Well practiced, mental patterns, that you can easily draw into your mind. This is all part of the process of gaining expertise in a subject. Metaphors and analogies can make learning super simple. Remember, these metaphors and analogies often just serve to give us a sense of key ideas. Whenever we've reached the limits of an analogy for helping us to understand something, we can always just throw that analogy away and pick up a new one. Of course, there's often many different analogies that we can use to explain any concept. So let's review, while having a little fun by describing the focus and diffuse modes using some different analogies. It turns out that your brain puts its energy, for the most part, into either the focused mode or the diffuse mode. It can't be in both modes at same time, not unless you're ingesting certain forms of mushrooms and we're certainly not suggesting you do that. Focused mode is what happens when you concentrate, it turns on virtually instantly. Diffuse mode, on the other hand, is when you're not concentrating on anything. Instead, it's when your thoughts are moving randomly, like when you're sitting on a bus, standing in a shower or going for a walk. Diffuse mode kind of sneaks up on you, you're often not aware of having fallen into the diffuse mode. So, let's look a little more closely at what's going on in the focused versus the diffuse modes. Here's a top scale view looking down onto your brain, you can see the little ears right here, and the nose is on the top. And we know that the brain is kind of like a set of networks, this is the focused mode network. Look how small those little meshes are, these are sometimes called task positive networks. Because different parts of the networks are activated depending on what task you're working on. Multiplication say, versus conjugating a verb in Spanish or kicking a soccer ball. What we call the diffuse mode is like a different set of networks, with much bigger meshes. Diffuse mode is actually a catchall term that we use to signify any of the neural resting states. The most prominent resting state, incidentally, is called the default mode network. The thing about the diffuse mode, is that it helps us to make these intuitive leaps, connections between new ideas you didn't realize were connected. The diffuse mode has another purpose as well, it's the mode we fall into when we're trying to consolidate and understand new information. We'll get to that in just a minute, the diffuse mode only turns on when you aren't thinking about anything in particular. So you can't just concentrate and turn it on like you can with the focused mode. But the relaxed, diffuse mode, is the mode that often does that background processing that helps us solve difficult problems and understand difficult concepts. This is why, when you're concentrating intently on something, and you find yourself getting really frustrated, the best thing you can do is often to get your concentration off what you're trying to understand. Getting your attention off the topic helps open up the very different diffuse mode networks, and lets your brain find new paths for thinking about what you're trying to understand. Then, when you later return to focusing, you'll find yourself in a better place, mentally. The problem or the concept will suddenly start to make sense. Incidentally, the habit of writing down a problem that you're trying to solve before going to bed will help you calm your mind and let your nighttime brain think of a solution. There's actually another, very different way, to think about focused and diffuse modes and that's using something called an excavator. When you focus on something, your mind is in receiving mode, information is pouring in. When you're in diffuse mode, on the other hand, your brain is turning around, so to speak, and placing that new information in other parts of your brain. Organizing and making sense of the new material, you can only be in one mode at the same time. The inputting focused mode or the organizing, diffuse mode, where the brain is consolidating that information. This is why it's really important to take little study breaks, and give yourself time where you're not focusing on the material at hand. The little break is what helps the brain consolidate the new information so it can later think more creatively about it. Go ahead, take a little break now, try to move around a little while you do it. You'll be surprised at how much it refreshes you.
我们还描述了建立神经“块”库的重要性。这些是您可以轻松调取的熟练心智模式，是掌握学科知识过程中不可或缺的一部分。隐喻和类比能够让学习变得极其简单。请记住，这些隐喻和类比通常只是帮助我们理解关键概念的工具。当某个类比不再适用于帮助我们理解某件事时，我们可以抛弃它，换一个新的。当然，任何概念往往都有许多不同的类比可供选择。

那么，让我们在轻松的气氛中，用不同的类比来回顾专注模式和发散模式。大脑的能量大多集中在专注模式或发散模式中，两者不能同时存在，除非您摄取了某些特定的蘑菇，而我们当然不建议您这么做。专注模式是在您集中注意力时开启的，几乎瞬间启动。而发散模式则是在您没有特别专注于任何事物时，大脑的思维随意流动，比如坐在公交车上、站在淋浴间里或散步时。发散模式通常悄然启动，您可能并未察觉到自己进入了发散模式。

现在，让我们更深入地了解专注模式和发散模式发生了什么。从顶视角来看大脑，就像一组网络，这是专注模式网络。注意这些小网格的细密程度，这些有时被称为“任务积极网络”，因为不同的任务会激活网络的不同部分，例如乘法计算、西班牙语动词的变位或踢足球。

我们所说的发散模式则像是另一组网格，网格更大。发散模式实际上是一个总称，表示所有神经的静息状态。其中最显著的静息状态被称为默认模式网络。发散模式的特点在于，它帮助我们进行直觉跳跃，连接那些看似不相关的新想法。发散模式还有另一个作用，即帮助我们整合和理解新信息。发散模式只在您没有特别专注于某事时启动，因此不能像专注模式那样通过集中注意力来激活它。但放松的发散模式常常会进行背景处理，帮助我们解决难题和理解复杂概念。

因此，当您在集中精力学习某件事并感到十分沮丧时，最好的方法往往是转移注意力。将注意力从问题上移开有助于激活发散模式网络，让大脑找到新的路径去思考所学内容。之后当您再次回到专注状态时，您会发现自己在精神上更有准备，问题或概念突然变得清晰了。顺便提一下，在入睡前写下您正在努力解决的问题可以帮助您平静下来，并让夜间的大脑思考解决方案。

另一个思考专注和发散模式的方式是使用“挖掘机”的比喻。当您专注于某件事时，大脑处于接收模式，信息源源不断地流入。而在发散模式中，您的大脑则开始“转身”，将新信息分配到大脑的其他部分，整理并理解这些新材料。您一次只能处于一种模式中——专注模式或组织整合的发散模式，即大脑在整合信息。这就是为什么需要小小的学习休息时间，给自己一个不专注于材料的片刻。这个小休息能帮助大脑巩固新信息，从而在之后更具创造性地思考内容。

现在就稍作休息吧，活动一下身体。您会惊讶于这种方式带来的清新感。



### 1-7 Should You Listen to Music When You're Studying?

What would you like research to tell you? Would you like it to say it's okay to listen to music when you're studying? Or would you rather that research would find that it's better not to listen to music when you're studying?
你希望研究告诉你什么？是希望研究表明学习时听音乐是可以的，还是希望研究发现不听音乐更好呢？

Let's pause for a moment to take a survey and see what you think.
让我们先暂停片刻，进行一项调查，看看您的看法。

I have a little insight for you. Whatever you wanted that research to tell you, whether it was to listen to music or not to listen to music, you can find research that will back you up. Here's what we do know. If the music is fast and loud, it disrupts reading comprehension,
in part because you use some of the same areas of the brain to process music as you do to process language. Also, music with lyrics is more distracting than music without lyrics. On the other hand, researchers have found that if you're listening to a favorite style of music it could enhance your studies. Or if it's something you don't like it could detract. In the final analysis, all this means that when it comes to music you should use commonsense and discover what works best for you.
我这里有一个小见解。无论您希望研究支持听音乐还是不听音乐，您都可以找到相关的研究支持您的立场。已知的是，如果音乐快而响，会影响阅读理解，部分原因是处理音乐和语言的大脑区域有重叠。此外，带歌词的音乐比无歌词的音乐更容易分散注意力。另一方面，研究发现，如果您在听自己喜欢的音乐风格，可能有助于学习，而如果是您不喜欢的音乐，可能会产生反效果。总之，关于音乐的问题，应当用常识判断，找出最适合自己的方法。



### 1-8 Learning Something Hard? The Coffee Shop Trick

When we're studying we often drink caffeine, which enhances focus by diminishing the day dreaming alpha waves in our brain.
学习时，我们经常会饮用含咖啡因的饮品，咖啡因通过减少大脑中的白日梦阿尔法波来增强专注力。

This effect is strongest for about an hour after drinking a cup of coffee or tea. Although the energizing can persist about eight hours, which is why it's sometimes better to avoid that evening cup of coffee. But when you're doing something that is cognitively difficult, coffee isn't the only booster. You're often subconsciously using other tricks to increase your focus. For example, if you're trying to remember something, you tend to avert your gaze. Which avoids overloading your working memory with unnecessary extra visual information from your environment. Even just closing your eyes can help you ignore distractors when you're trying to bring something to mind. Let's be honest here. Memorizing comes more easily for some people than others. Researchers still aren't quite sure why, although there's some evidence that having the right genes helps. But believe it or not, being a good memorizer can cause problems. In medical schools for example, when there's a big anatomy test, ordinary medical students spend weeks preparing. They will practice over and over again to memorize thousands of terms in their related functions. Gifted memorizers, on the other hand, can procrastinate until just a few days before the test, spend a few hours glancing over the material, and they can still do well. However, when these same memorizing aces are faced with a different type of medical school exam, for example a test related to how the heart functions, they find that just a few hours of last minute cramming just don't cut it. Medical school advisors can sometimes be startled to find these seemingly star students flunking certain sections of the curriculum. It seems that quickly memorizing anatomical terms related to the heart doesn't allow you to understand and answer questions about the heart's complex function. This is a reminder that simple focused concentration in memorization often isn't enough when we're trying to understand a complicated issue. It takes time to understand complicated systems. Whether we're trying to understand how to put together a new lighting rig,  figuring out a pumping system of a human heart, or analyzing the multifaceted causes of World War II. To untangle such complicated subjects, we often need to alternate a tight focus on the issue at hand with steps back to look at the bigger picture. Our need for occasional distraction during any given learning session may arise from these competing type focus versus big picture kinds of needs. Basically, it's focused versus diffuse modes. The focus mode is primarily centered in the prefrontal cortex, the front part of the brain. The diffuse mode, on the other hand, involves a network connecting more wide spread areas of the brain. The more extensive nature of diffused thinking is why it's often related to the unexpected connections that lie at the heart of creativity. Activities involving the diffuse mode like walking, or riding a bus, relaxing, or falling asleep, are more likely to lead you to creative ideas that can seem to arise from nowhere. If we're in a very quiet environment, that quietness can hype up the focused mode attention circuits while simultaneously deactivating the diffuse mode. This is why quiet environments are ideal when we're doing something that demands full concentrated attention, like doing our taxes or working on a difficult problem on a test. But sometimes we're trying to understand bigger picture sorts of issues like cardiac function or computer network connectivity. In that case, a little sporadic noise, like a snippet of conversation with or the clatter of dishes in the back round of a coffee shop can help. This is because that bit of noise temporarily allows the longer range diffuse network to pop up. So, we briefly get a new perspective. This is so effective that there are even apps with coffee shop sounds. In the discussion forum, you might want to describe some of your favorite ideas for places to study and unexpected apps that have helped your learning. Of course, there can come a point when there's just too much noise, which can keep you from concentrating at all. Finding a good learning environment can take a bit of exploration. But that's good because it keeps you from getting too accustomed to any one study place, which can make your learning more effective.
喝一杯咖啡或茶后，咖啡因的效果在一小时左右最为显著。尽管提神作用可以持续约八小时，这也是为何有时晚上最好避免咖啡。但在处理认知难度较高的任务时，咖啡并不是唯一的提神剂。我们通常会下意识地运用其他技巧来提高专注力。例如，当我们试图记住某些内容时，会习惯性地转移视线，以避免环境中不必要的额外视觉信息给工作记忆带来负担。甚至闭上眼睛也有助于排除干扰，更容易回忆所需内容。

让我们坦诚一些，记忆力对某些人来说更为轻松。研究人员尚不完全清楚原因，但有证据表明，遗传基因可能起作用。然而，优秀的记忆力也可能带来问题。在医学院，当解剖学考试临近时，普通医学生会花数周反复练习，以记住成千上万的术语及其功能。但天赋超群的记忆高手可能会拖延到考试前几天，仅用几小时快速浏览材料，并且仍然考得不错。然而，当这些记忆高手面对另一种类型的考试时，比如心脏功能相关的测试，他们会发现匆忙记忆几小时并不奏效。医学院的导师们有时会惊讶地发现，这些看似优异的学生在某些课程上挂科。看来，快速记住心脏相关的解剖学术语并不能帮助理解和解答心脏复杂功能的问题。

这提醒我们，在尝试理解复杂问题时，单靠专注于记忆并不够。理解复杂系统需要时间，不论是学习如何搭建新的灯光装置、研究人类心脏的泵送系统，还是分析二战的多方面原因。要解开这些复杂主题，我们通常需要在紧盯问题细节与退后看全局之间交替进行。学习过程中偶尔分心的需求，可能正源于专注与大局视角之间的竞争需求。

基本上，这就是专注模式和发散模式。专注模式主要集中在大脑的前额皮质，而发散模式涉及一个连接大脑更多区域的网络。发散性思维的更广泛特性，使其常常与创造力核心的意外联系相关。发散模式活动如散步、乘公交车、放松或入睡，更可能带来似乎凭空而来的创意。在非常安静的环境中，这种寂静会加强专注模式的注意力回路，同时抑制发散模式。这就是为什么安静的环境非常适合需要全神贯注的任务，例如报税或应对测试中的难题。

但有时我们在试图理解更宏观的问题，例如心脏功能或计算机网络连接，此时一点断续的噪音——如咖啡馆里的对话片段或餐具碰撞声，反而有帮助。这是因为这种噪音可以暂时激活长距离的发散网络，使我们从新的视角看待问题。这一方法非常有效，甚至出现了带有咖啡馆背景音的应用程序。

在讨论区中，您可以分享您喜欢的学习场所和对您学习有帮助的意想不到的应用程序。当然，噪音过多也会影响注意力，找到合适的学习环境可能需要探索。不过，这种探索有益于避免过于依赖同一个学习地点，使学习更有效。


### 1-9 Your environment affects who you are

What do you feel when you walk into a cathedral?
当你走进一座大教堂时，你会有什么感觉？

Light is streaming in through the stained glass. The ceiling soars above your head.Cavernous echoes create a sense of a vast space.It smells old. Compared to the world outside, your brain tells you that this space is sacred.It makes you feel different. It elicits different thoughts. You are different person inside the cathedral.
阳光透过彩色玻璃倾泻而入，天花板在头顶高耸，空旷的回声营造出一种广阔的空间感，弥漫着历史的气息。和外面的世界相比，你的大脑告诉你，这里是一个神圣的地方。这让你感到不同，唤起了不同的思绪。在教堂里，你仿佛成了另一个人。

Now walk in to a stadium filled with 100,000 fans for a football game. The sights are brighter than outside the stadium, and the sounds are much louder.  The crowd roars when a goal is stored.You are caught up in the emotional moment. This is why we still go to live sporting events, even though the camera angles are much, much better on TV.
现在，走进一个容纳十万名球迷的体育场，观看一场足球比赛。场内的光线比场外更亮，声音也更响亮。当进球得分时，观众欢呼沸腾。你被这情绪化的时刻所感染。这就是我们仍然亲临体育赛事的原因，尽管电视上的镜头视角更加完美。

These experiences have an impact on your brain. Whether you immerse yourself in a quiet, contemplative environment, or a hyper-stimulated one, you are changing your thought patterns, and that changes your brain. Different emotional states, different memories, different brain. Is your environment helping you to achieve our goals? Sometimes even small changes in your environment can lead to big differences over time.
这些体验对大脑有着深刻影响。无论你沉浸在安静、沉思的环境中，还是在高度刺激的环境中，你都在改变你的思维模式，这也会改变你的大脑。不同的情绪状态、不同的记忆，意味着不同的大脑。你的环境是否在帮助你实现目标？有时，即使环境中微小的变化，随着时间推移也会带来巨大的差异。

The Salk Institute for Biological Studies where I work is a special place. As you approach the Salk Institute from outside, it looks like a concrete fortress. But as you enter the central courtyard, there is a dramatic change. A broad expands of travertine stretches out to the Pacific Ocean with towers rising along the sides, anchoring the other worldly space. The Salk Institute was designed by Louis Khan, a famous architect working together with Jonas Salk, who invented the vaccine that cured polio in the 1950s. The building is an architectural landmark. Jonas was a medical researcher but he founded an institute whose mission was basic science. Our motto, cures begin here. Salk reinvented himself as a visionary, and wanted his institute to inspire the researchers working there to make important scientific breakthroughs, and we have.
我工作的索尔克生物研究所是一个特殊的地方。从外面看，索尔克研究所像一座混凝土要塞，但当你走入中央庭院时，景象骤然一变。宽阔的石灰华庭院延伸向太平洋，两侧的塔楼耸立，支撑起这一片超凡脱俗的空间。索尔克研究所由著名建筑师路易斯·康设计，他与乔纳斯·索尔克——1950年代发明治愈脊髓灰质炎疫苗的医学研究人员——携手合作完成了这座建筑。这栋建筑是建筑史上的一座地标。乔纳斯虽然是医学研究人员，却创立了以基础科学为使命的研究所。我们的座右铭是：“治愈从这里开始。”索尔克重新定义了自己，成为了一个有远见的开拓者，期望他的研究所能激励在此工作的研究人员取得重要的科学突破，而我们也确实如此。

I am inspired every day when I arrive for work. The entrance opens onto the tea room, the heart of my lab. Students in my lab come from many countries and have diverse backgrounds. And they all gather around the tea table every day at 3:30. Some of the most important scientific ideas from my lab arose from tea time discussions.
每天来到工作场所时我都会感到受到启发。入口通向茶室，这是我实验室的核心。我的实验室学生来自不同国家，背景多样，他们每天都会在3点半聚集在茶桌旁。我实验室中一些最重要的科学想法正是源于茶歇时的讨论。

The ceilings in my lab are 10 feet high. Studies have shown that people think and act differently in environments with high ceilings. They think more freely and abstractly. People in a room with low ceilings are more likely to focus on the specifics.
实验室的天花板高达10英尺。研究表明，高天花板的环境会让人以更自由、抽象的方式思考和行动。而在低天花板的房间里，人们更倾向于关注细节。

All of these factors are important for building a community of passionate and creative researchers. Now let's walk into a hospital.
所有这些因素都对建立一个充满热情和创造力的研究社区至关重要。现在让我们走进一间医院。

They are remarkably similar in their layout in every city and almost all countries. In 2004, I attended a workshop in Woods Hole, Massachusetts sponsored by the Academy of Neuroscience for Architecture that explored the design of health care facilities. The workshop was an eye opener. Based on what we know about environments that promote health and healing, modern hospitals could not be more badly designed. Look! First, let's look at the lighting.
各地的医院在布局上惊人地相似，无论在各个城市还是几乎所有国家。2004年，我参加了在马萨诸塞州伍兹霍尔由神经科学建筑学会举办的研讨会，探讨医疗设施的设计。这次研讨会让我大开眼界。根据我们对促进健康和疗愈环境的认知，现代医院的设计可谓极其不合理。请看！首先，我们来看看照明。

Many studies have shown that lighting has a pervasive effect on physiology and behavior. Outdoor light promotes arousal. Dark indoor lighting provokes inactivity. Large windows with views of nature encourage healing. Rooms with small windows overlooking parking lots are depressing.
许多研究表明，照明对生理和行为有着深远的影响。户外光线能促进兴奋，而昏暗的室内光则会引发懒散情绪。大窗户并能看到自然景观的房间有助于康复，而仅能看到停车场的小窗户则令人压抑。

The sickest patients are sent to the intensive care unit, where there are no windows, and the light is kept at the same level all day long.
病情最严重的患者会被送到重症监护室，但那里没有窗户，光线全天保持在同一水平。

We have a circadian clock that regulates awake and sleep cycles, which are entrained by bright light.
我们体内有一个昼夜节律时钟，调节着醒睡周期，并受明亮光线的同步。当你前往一个不同的时区时，会感到迷失，直到昼夜节律重新调整。

When you travel to a distant time zone you feel disoriented for days until your circadian clock has shifted.
让患者处于恒定的光照环境中，会使大脑失去时间感，对昼夜毫无概念。

Putting a patient into constant lighting untethers their brain, making it clueless about the time of day.
声音也是疗愈环境中的重要一部分。医院中的警报可以在任何时间响起，以提醒工作人员注意突发事件。

Sound is also an important part of the healing environment. Alarms can go off any time of the day or night in a hospital to alert the staff of an emergency.
声音也是疗愈环境中的重要因素。在医院中，警报随时可能响起，提醒工作人员应对紧急情况。

This also alarms the brains of the sick people who have enough to worry about without a menacing sound.
然而，这种警报声也会惊扰患者的大脑，使本已忧虑重重的他们更加紧张。

Good nutrition is essential to building a strong body and healthy brain.I have eaten some of the worst food ever in hospitals, unhealthy choices, poorly prepared, go figure. Finally and above all, it is stressful to live in an unpredictable environment. The privacy of hospital patients can be invaded any time of the day or night for an examination, a teaching moment, a blood draw, or even more invasive procedures. If you were worried about your health before arriving at a hospital, the environment there will amplify your worries.
良好的营养对构建强健的身体和健康的大脑至关重要。但我在医院里吃过最差的食物，既不健康又准备得粗糙，令人无语。最后，最重要的是，在不可预测的环境中生活会带来压力。医院里的患者隐私随时可能被打扰——可能是为了检查、教学、抽血，甚至更具侵入性的操作。如果在入院前您已经为健康担忧，那么医院的环境将加剧您的忧虑。
Look around you and notice your environment.Is it conducive to your goals? Is there a way that it can be changed? Sometimes, just changing your walking route can brighten your surroundings.
环顾四周，留意您的环境。它是否有助于您的目标？是否有办法进行改变？有时，仅仅改变步行路线就能让周围环境更令人愉悦。



### 1-10 The Changing World – Matching Aspirations with Opportunity

Horses have been horses the way we know them today for hundreds of thousands of years. In previous evolutionary times, people just ate them, along with buffalo and pretty much any other big game they came across. But about 6,000 years ago, when people figured out that horses could actually be ridden instead of just eaten, the human world started changing dramatically. Suddenly, people could get from place to place a lot more easily, a lot more easily. And this had profound effects on the development of human societies. For example, in the late Middle Ages, the Mongol Empire grew to be one of the largest empires in history, in part because of the tough, scruffy Mongolian horses they used in battle. This is why some argue that the simple idea of the stirrup on a horse's saddle, which gave much greater stability for the rider, was as important an invention as the printing press. We can see the power of the horse even in the recent centuries.
马作为我们今天所认识的模样，已经存在了数十万年。在更早的进化时期，人类只是把马当作食物，与野牛及其他大型猎物一起食用。但大约6000年前，人们发现马不仅可以吃，还可以骑，这一发现极大地改变了人类的世界。突然之间，人们可以更轻松地从一个地方到达另一个地方，而这对人类社会的发展产生了深远的影响。例如，在中世纪晚期，蒙古帝国成为历史上最大的帝国之一，部分原因在于他们在战斗中使用了坚韧、粗犷的蒙古马。这就是为什么有人认为马鞍上的马镫这一简单发明具有与印刷术同等重要的地位，因为它为骑手提供了更大的稳定性。甚至在近几个世纪中，我们仍然能看到马匹的强大影响力。

In the 1700s for example, in the Midwestern plains of the United States, an extraordinary people came into prominence, the Native American group known as the Comanche. They commanded vast swathes of land in what is now Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, and Oklahoma. The Comanche took the culture of the horse to one of the highest levels in human history. Their equine expertise astonished all who knew them. They could outride pretty much anyone, hooking their legs across their ponies' backs and firing arrows under their ponies' necks, keeping their enemies at bay, while using their horse as a protective cover. In the 1700's in fact, all around the world, there were a myriad of jobs that related to horses. Blacksmiths were needed for horses' shoes and to fashion stirrups and bits. There was a demand for wagon, cart, buggy, plow, and harness makers, riders, drivers, couriers, herders. Even if you weren't making or doing something directly related to horses, you still needed to be able to handle a horse, whether you were a monarch, a mercenary or a minister. Horses were an important part of almost everyone's lives, as important in some ways as the computer or smartphone is today. But of course, eras and cultures change. From the horse, we eventually transitioned to the automobile, and all sorts of technologies begin to arise based on the internal combustion engine, from snowmobiles to bulldozers, to jet aircraft. Communications began to play a powerful role too, with the emergence first of the telegraph, then the telephone, and then television, satellites, and of course the Internet.
例如在18世纪，美国中西部大平原上，一个非凡的民族崛起了——科曼奇族，这是一支原住民部落。他们统治着如今的德克萨斯、新墨西哥、科罗拉多和俄克拉荷马的广大地区。科曼奇族将马文化推到了人类历史的巅峰之一。他们的马术技艺令所有见过他们的人惊叹不已。他们几乎能超越任何对手，将双腿挂在小马背上，甚至能在小马脖子下方射箭，以马匹作为掩护抵挡敌人。事实上，在18世纪，世界各地有着无数与马相关的职业。铁匠为马匹打造马蹄铁、马镫和缰绳；车匠、马车制造者、犁具和马具制造者、骑手、驾车人、信使、牧马人等应运而生。即便不从事与马直接相关的工作，也必须学会驾驭马匹，不论是国王、雇佣兵还是传教士。马在几乎每个人的生活中都占据着重要地位，某些方面的作用可与今日的电脑或智能手机相媲美。但时代与文化总在变化。从马匹开始，我们逐步过渡到汽车，并且基于内燃机的各种技术逐渐出现，从雪地摩托到推土机再到喷气式飞机。与此同时，通信也开始扮演重要角色，先是电报，随后是电话、电视、卫星，当然还有互联网的兴起。

And electrical power and safe, clean sources for that power are still of prime importance. So we're living nowadays in a world that's very unlike that of the 1700s. But what our development sense then shows is that people's abilities to learn new things and to grapple with new ideas, to make mindshifts, are the key element in producing vibrant and creative societies, and in helping people to live to their full potential. It's important to be able to match your aspirations and passions with the opportunities that surround you today, as well as the opportunities that will unfold in the days, months and years to come. You want to look at yourself, your career, your knowledge base, with the same sort of big picture perspective that we've just used to consider the development of human societies over the last few centuries. One idea in particular is especially important, which is that whatever skill set and knowledge base you may already have related to your career, your family and children, or your hobbies, it's vital to keep in mind that we're living in a world where at least some passing knowledge of computers, technology, math and science is as important as the knowledge of horsemanship was in centuries gone by. Everyone needs passion in their lives, things you like and enjoy and are good at, but an important part of what we'll be talking about in this MOOC is broadening your passions. That is, we want to encourage you to explore new directions in learning that might not have felt comfortable for you before. If you're a natural techie type, we want to encourage you to broaden your passions and skill set into non-technical areas. Maybe public speaking, or writing, or art. If you're a non-techie type, we'd like to encourage you to go the other way, towards gathering some analytical and technical skills in your arsenal. Whatever your age and whatever your previous training, you want to be able to be flexible and open, and to be able to change and adapt in today's much more rapidly changing world. Mindshift is a MOOC designed to provide a framework for your change, even as you remain true to yourself.
电力以及安全、清洁的电力来源仍然至关重要。因此，我们生活在一个与18世纪截然不同的世界。但自那时以来的发展历程显示，人们学习新事物、应对新思想、进行思维转变的能力，是建立充满活力和创造力的社会、帮助人们发挥全部潜能的关键因素。能够将自己的抱负和热情与当下周围的机会相匹配，并预见未来几天、几个月甚至几年的机会，这一点十分重要。

你需要以一种大局观来看待自己、职业、知识基础，正如我们刚才所做的那样，审视过去几个世纪中人类社会的发展。有一个特别重要的观点，即无论你目前在职业、家庭、子女或爱好方面具备何种技能和知识基础，记住我们生活在一个至少需要一些计算机、技术、数学和科学常识的世界，就如过去的骑术知识一样重要。每个人生活中都需要激情，追求自己喜欢、擅长的事情，但这门慕课中将重点探讨拓宽你的热情。我们希望鼓励你探索一些你之前可能不太熟悉的新学习方向。

如果你天生擅长技术领域，我们希望你能拓宽热情和技能，进入非技术领域，或许是公共演讲、写作或艺术。如果你并非技术型人才，我们则希望你朝相反方向发展，将一些分析和技术技能加入你的武器库。无论你的年龄或之前的培训背景如何，都需要保持灵活开放，在当今瞬息万变的世界中能够改变和适应。《思维转变》这门慕课旨在提供一个框架，帮助你进行改变，同时保持自我。



### 1-11 Natural Passions, Career Choice, and Gender


We should take a few minutes here to touch on the differences between men and women when it comes to natural passions. A biggie here is the hormone testosterone. Testosterone has lots of effects, especially on guys, because guys have lots more of it. Testosterone makes for mustaches, and maybe a bit more cocky behavior, and all sorts of guy things that I tend to kind of like. Even in the womb, guys generally have lots more testosterone than gals. Okay, here I want to show a chart that reveals how testosterone makes a difference in the development of boys and girls math abilities.
我们在这里花几分钟来探讨男女在天然兴趣方面的差异。一个重要的因素就是激素睾酮。睾酮有很多作用，尤其是对男性，因为男性的睾酮含量比女性高得多。睾酮导致胡须的生长，可能让人更自信，产生各种典型的“男子气概”，这些特点我其实蛮喜欢的。甚至在胎儿时期，男性通常也比女性有更多的睾酮。现在我想展示一张图表，揭示睾酮在男孩和女孩数学能力发展中的影响。

Well,  obviously, there isn't really an effect. Where testosterone does have an effect, at least early on, is in verbal abilities. As infants and children develop, it turns out that testosterone can serve as a sort of developmental drag on verbal abilities. So little boys, who have more testosterone, tend on average to get a bit delayed behind girls in their verbal development. This is part of why girls, on average, are more verbally advanced than boys. Remember, boys and girls are roughly equivalent on average in their math and science skills. But when you start to put things together, on average, a girl can look within herself and her own abilities and say, hey, you know what, I'm kind of better at verbal sorts of things. And it's true. A boy, on the other hand, can look within himself, and say, hey, I'm a little better at math kind of things and that's true too. And all of these happen even though girls and boys have roughly the same basic ability to do math.
显然，睾酮对数学能力并没有明显的影响。睾酮的影响，至少在早期，主要体现在语言能力上。随着婴儿和儿童的发展，睾酮会在一定程度上拖慢语言能力的发育。因此，睾酮更多的小男孩在语言发展上平均稍微落后于小女孩。这也是为什么平均而言，女孩的语言能力比男孩更为先进的一部分原因。
记住，男孩和女孩在数学和科学技能方面平均水平是大致相当的。但综合来看，女孩往往会发现自己在语言方面略有优势，而这也确实如此。而男孩则可能意识到自己在数学方面稍占优势，这同样也是真的。这一切都发生在男孩和女孩拥有大致相同的基本数学能力的前提下。

Keep in mind that this is just an average. Individuals can vary quite a bit. And while boys can catch up later in their verbal development, by then, their self image has already begun to solidify. We often develop passions about what we're really good at. As it turns out, it seems easier for girls to get good at subjects requiring strong verbal skills. For boys, quantitative subjects can seem easier than those involving verbal skills. Remember, again this is even though boys and girls have roughly the same basic abilities to do math and science. Unfortunately, what all this does mean is that girls frequent big advantage. Their more advanced verbal skills can inadvertently also serve as a disadvantage. Because of their early verbal advantage, women can sometimes come to believe that their passions lie in language-oriented areas which accounts for part of the reason that there are a fewer women in the technical and scientific fields. Despite the fact that women, as well as men, are strongly needed in those fields. Passions develop about what we're good at but some things take longer for us to get good at. In fact, research has shown that if something seems hard for us, we can actually learn it better than if it was straightforward and easy. All of this can have a bearing on what career paths we tend to choose, especially when we hear advice like, follow your passion which is often taken to mean, do what comes easiest for you. In the discussion forum, describe what you've done or plan to do to broaden your passions in learning, going beyond what you feel you're naturally good at. You can help inspire us all. I'm Barbara Oakley, happy Mindshift.
请记住，这只是一个平均趋势，个体差异可能很大。尽管男孩在语言发展上可以在之后赶上，但那时他们的自我形象已经开始定型了。我们往往对自己擅长的事情更容易产生热情。结果来看，女孩更容易擅长需要较强语言技能的科目，而男孩在定量科目上可能比语言相关的科目更得心应手。再提醒一次，即便如此，男孩和女孩在数学和科学的基本能力上还是相近的。

不幸的是，这一切也意味着女孩的一个显著优势——更高的语言能力，有时会无意中成为劣势。由于她们早期的语言优势，女性有时会认为自己的兴趣在语言相关领域，这也是为什么技术和科学领域中的女性相对较少的部分原因，尽管这些领域迫切需要男女共同参与。热情往往建立在我们擅长的领域之上，但有些技能需要更长时间才能变得擅长。

事实上，研究表明，若某项内容对我们来说困难，我们的学习效果反而会比简单易学的内容更好。这一切都可能影响我们选择的职业道路，特别是当我们听到“追随你的热情”这样的建议时，通常会理解为“选择你最容易的事情去做”。在讨论区中，欢迎大家分享你们为拓宽学习兴趣而做的或计划做的努力，超越你们觉得自己天生擅长的领域，启发我们所有人。



### 1-12 Week 1 Wrap Up

We've had a busy week here in Mindshift. Here are a few of the key points we covered. First, it's okay to be a slow learner. In fact slow learners can some times catch errors that even geniuses miss. Precisely because they're looking at things more slowly and carefully. And as research on mastery learning shows. If you're a slow learner, it may take you more time to learn something, but you can absolutely grasp the material just as well as, and sometimes even better than, fast, racecar brain learners. We also learned how important it is to take active steps yourself in whatever you are learning. Watching a video or reading a book forms a great start to learning and sometimes it's true. That's all you need. But if you are learning something you want to be able to do yourself, whether it's coding, math, speaking another language, learning to dance. Or anything else, you need to actively practice yourself if you want to develop any sort of expertise. Just watching someone solve a problem or speak another language, for example, isn't enough.
在《思维转变》的这一周，我们度过了忙碌的一周，以下是我们讨论的一些关键点。首先，做个慢速学习者完全没问题。事实上，慢速学习者有时能够发现天才们都可能遗漏的错误，正是因为他们以更慢、更仔细的方式观察事物。正如掌握性学习的研究表明，如果您是慢速学习者，虽然学习某些内容可能需要更多时间，但您绝对可以掌握材料，甚至有时比那些快速的“赛车”大脑学习者更好。

我们还了解到在学习中主动参与的重要性。观看视频或阅读书籍是学习的良好开端，有时确实是您所需要的全部。但如果您在学习想要亲自掌握的技能，比如编程、数学、外语、舞蹈或其他任何内容，那么如果想培养某种专业水平，就需要自己主动练习。仅仅看别人解决问题或讲另一种语言是不够的。

Career wise, we learned that your past can have great value for your future even if it seems completely disconnected. So don't feel bad if your past at first.
在职业方面，我们了解到即使过去的经历看似与未来毫无关联，它依然对未来有巨大价值。所以，即便一开始觉得自己的过去没有帮助，也不要因此感到失落。

We looked at focused versus diffuse ways of thinking. And we discovered that slight occasional disruptions as when you're studying in a coffee shop can enhance your ability to learn more difficult big picture sorts of concepts. Music isn't necessarily bad, although it's perhaps best to stick to music without lyrics that isn't too loud. And we found that environment can make a surprising difference in how you feel. We also got an overview of the changing nature of today's world, and the important role of not only language and culture, but of technology. Sometimes your natural passions can fool you. It's important to take a strategic as well as a passion influenced approach to your learning. Next week we'll be getting deeper into happy learning. See you soon!
我们探讨了专注和发散思维方式的区别，发现偶尔的轻微干扰（如在咖啡馆学习时）能够增强学习复杂、大局观概念的能力。音乐并非一定有害，最好选择没有歌词且音量适中的音乐。同时我们了解到，环境会对人的情绪产生意想不到的影响。我们还概览了当今世界的变化特性，不仅语言和文化扮演着重要角色，技术同样重要。

有时，天生的兴趣也可能误导我们，因此在学习中采取既有激情驱动又具战略性的方式非常重要。下周，我们将更深入地探讨快乐学习。期待再见！



### Optional Video: How to Integrate a Flashcard Retrieval Practice System into This Course

When you're trying to learn, your tendency can be to reread what you're learning, or highlight, or underline. But the best way to learn involves an approach called "retrieval practice." You may already know this term. But to better explain it, let's back up a moment to see what happens in your brain when you're learning.
当你尝试学习时，往往会倾向于反复阅读、做标记或划线。然而，最有效的学习方法是一种叫做“提取练习”的方法。你可能已经听说过这个术语。但为了更好地解释它，我们先回顾一下当你学习时大脑中发生了什么。

When you learn something—anything— you are creating links between neurons in long-term memory. Each time you retrieve these ideas from your own mind, you're strengthening those sets of links. Hundreds of studies have shown that retrieval practice— retrieving the ideas from your own mind—is the best approach to learning. It not only builds memory but also significantly boosts your conceptual understanding. What's the best way to do retrieval practice? Use flashcards, repeating your practice over a number of days until you can retrieve the ideas, approaches, or techniques easily from your own mind.
当你学习某件事时——无论是什么——你都在长时记忆中创建神经元之间的连接。每次从自己脑中提取这些想法时，都是在加强这些连接。数百项研究表明，提取练习（即从自己脑中提取想法）是最佳的学习方法。它不仅能增强记忆，还能显著提升对概念的理解。

那么，进行提取练习的最佳方式是什么呢？使用闪卡（记忆卡），在数天内反复练习，直到你能轻松从脑中提取出这些想法、方法或技术。

Let's take a couple of minutes and show you how you can use an app called iDoRecall to create spaced repetition flashcards right here on Coursera as you take this course. First, go to iDoRecall.com to create a free account. Sign up here and verify your email. After you click the link in that email, you'll be taken inside iDoRecall for the first time. Next, go to the integration section in your profile and add the web clipper browser extension. The extension works only in Chrome-based browsers, and Microsoft Edge. Pin the extension here so that you can click on it whenever you need to activate it.
我们来花几分钟展示如何在Coursera上使用名为iDoRecall的应用来创建间隔重复的闪卡。首先，前往iDoRecall.com创建一个免费账号。注册并验证你的电子邮件，点击邮件中的链接后，将第一次进入iDoRecall。

接着，进入你的个人资料的集成部分，添加网页剪辑浏览器扩展。该扩展仅在基于Chrome的浏览器和Microsoft Edge中运行。将扩展固定在工具栏上，以便随时点击激活它。

Now you're ready to rock and roll with retrieving! After you watch one of the videos in our course, take a minute to skim the transcript. Pick out the key points that you want to remember and create a note by highlighting the text. Later on, head over to your notes section for the course. IDoRecall enables you to create spaced repetition flashcards that are linked to highlights or any subsequent notes that you add to enrich the highlights. Select some text. Create your flash card. We call these flashcards "recalls." Back in your free iDoRecall account, you can see the recall that we just created.
现在，你已经准备好开始“提取”练习了！观看完课程视频后，花一分钟浏览一下文字记录，挑选你想记住的要点，并通过高亮文本创建一条笔记。之后，前往课程的笔记部分。iDoRecall允许你创建与高亮或后续添加的补充笔记链接的间隔重复闪卡。

选择一些文本，创建你的闪卡，我们称这些闪卡为“recalls”。回到你的免费iDoRecall账户，你将看到刚刚创建的recall。

Let's practice memory retrieval. Read the question and do your best to retrieve the answer from your memory. By doing this, you're strengthening the synaptic connections between neurons and making it easier to retrieve and understand the memory, concept, or skill in the future. Now check the answer. If you struggled with the recall, click to see the source link. Your Coursera notes will open in a new browser tab.
让我们练习记忆提取。阅读问题，并尽量从记忆中提取答案。通过这样做，你在加强神经元之间的突触连接，使得未来更容易提取和理解这些记忆、概念或技能。现在检查答案。如果你在回忆时遇到困难，可以点击查看来源链接，你的Coursera笔记将会在新标签页中打开。

Click here to view the relevant portion of the video and refresh your memory in the context where you learned it. Each day, the iDoRecall spaced repetition algorithm will schedule for practice the small subset of the recalls that you're getting closest to forgetting. iDoRecall recall is free for the first 200 recalls in your account. This should be enough to both get you through the course and show you the power of a good flashcard system.
点击此处查看视频的相关部分，在原学习情境中刷新你的记忆。每天，iDoRecall的间隔重复算法会安排即将被遗忘的部分recall进行练习。在你的账户中，iDoRecall的前200张recall卡片是免费的。这应该足够你完成课程，同时体验到一个优秀闪卡系统的强大之处。



### Optional Bonus Video: Nelson Dellis Memory Tips #1

Hello, how you doing? My name's Nelson Dellis. What I'm going to do is show you how to memorize something you can use right now. Let's go.  All right, so what we're going to learn today, I'm going to make you make you memorize ten seemingly pretty random things. Cool?  Cool. The first thing we're going to do is we're going to choose ten body parts. We're going to start at the top of our head, that's going to be the first one. Then we're going to come down to our ears, that's two. Our eyes, this area, three. The nose, four. The mouth, five. The chin, six. The armpit, seven. Belly button chest area eight. The knees nine. And then down on the floor on my feet will be ten. Very simple. So, first things first, we're at the top of our head. I want you to picture some chopsticks.  There's some chopsticks on the top of my head, kind of picking out some sushi, whatever. There's two wooden sticks stuck in my hair. Okay, next, we're down to the ears, all right. Delicious Indian curry dish.
你好，最近怎么样？我叫尼尔森·德利斯。我将向你展示一个可以马上使用的记忆方法。准备好了吗？好，我们今天要学习的内容是，我会让你记住十个看似随机的东西，感觉如何？酷吧？首先，我们会选择十个身体部位。
我们从头顶开始，这是第一个。接下来是耳朵，第二个。眼睛区域，第三个。鼻子，第四个。嘴巴，第五个。下巴，第六个。腋下，第七个。肚脐或胸部区域，第八个。膝盖，第九个。然后到地面上的脚，第十个。非常简单。
那么，首先，我们从头顶开始。我希望你想象一些筷子，有些筷子在我的头顶，似乎在夹寿司之类的东西。有两根木筷插在我的头发里。好，接下来是耳朵，一个美味的印度咖喱菜。

Now really imagine you can taste it. It's overflowing, coming out of my ears. The actual sauce is hot and smells delicious you want to eat it, it's coming out of my ears.  Next we got a hamburger.  And that's going to go on the eyes. And imagine a burger is coming out of your eyes or that there's a burger blocking your eye. The juices from the beef coming out of your eye dripping down your cheek like a tear of beef sauce. All right, next, we're at the nose. We have this person putting a palm into the dough. So I want you to remember in dough.  Into the dough, in dough. And so imagine that's happening on my nose, so you're going to imagine someone pressing dough into my nose.
现在，真的想象一下你能尝到它的味道。酱汁溢出来了，从我的耳朵里流出来。酱汁是热的，闻起来很美味，让你想吃掉它，它从我的耳朵里流出来。接下来是汉堡。它要放在眼睛上。想象一个汉堡从你的眼睛里冒出来，或者有个汉堡挡住了你的眼睛。牛肉汁从你的眼睛里流出，像牛肉汁的泪滴一样顺着脸颊流下来。好吧，接下来是鼻子。有人把手掌按进面团中，我想让你记住“面团中”。按进面团，面团中。所以想象这发生在我的鼻子上，你要想象有人把面团压进我的鼻子里。

All right, the next one, on the mouth, we're going to picture a bra.  I want you to imagine a bra is just coming out of my mouth. I've got it deep down in my throat, I'm just like pulling it out and there it is, a bra coming out of my mouth.
好吧，接下来是嘴巴。我希望你想象一副胸罩。想象一下，一副胸罩正从我的嘴里出来。我深深地把它吞下，正拉出来，那里就是，一副胸罩从我的嘴里冒出来。

We move down to the chin. I want you to picture a pack of cards just resting on my chin.  And there's a dealer who wants to just deal these cards, these individual cards from the pack off of my chin. So that goes right there. So we've done the whole face. The next thing I want you to picture is that I lift my armpit, and splurting out of my armpit are a bunch of Cheerio type cereal. Boom.  Next, we're down at the bellybutton right. I want you to imagine that out of my bellybutton is a gun just firing all sorts of lint and gross bellybutton stuff out at you. And what sound does it make? Bang, right? Bang.  Imagine that right here, bang. So down here on the knees. Let's just imagine that we have a bunch of martini and vodka on the knees.  So this knee is the vodka and I pour it into this glass here, somehow like that. And now down to the feet. I have boots on, why not, because that's memorable. Down on the floor is a pan.  It's cooking something off of the floor, and it smells delicious. You just imagine the pan on the floor. You got all that? I hope so, and I want you to take a few minutes just to see if you can remember, starting at my head, and down to my feet, what the ten things were. I'm going to go do something while you do that. I'll be right back.  All right, that should've given you enough time to review everything. Let's go over them one more time just to see if you got them. First thing was the chopsticks on my head.
我们往下到下巴。我希望你想象一副扑克牌正静静地放在我的下巴上。有个发牌员想从我的下巴上发出这些牌。就这样。现在我们已经完成了整个面部。接下来，我希望你想象我抬起腋下，很多像麦圈那样的谷物正从我的腋下喷出来。砰！然后我们来到肚脐。我希望你想象，从我的肚脐里有一把枪正在发射各种绒毛和肚脐里的脏东西。它发出什么声音？砰，对吧？砰！想象就在这里，砰！接下来是膝盖。我们想象膝盖上有一堆马提尼和伏特加。这只膝盖是伏特加，我把它倒进这只杯子里，就像这样。最后，我们来到脚。我穿着靴子，为什么不呢，因为这样更容易记住。地上有一个锅，锅里正在煮东西，闻起来很美味。想象一下那个锅就在地上。你记住这些了吗？希望如此。我希望你花几分钟回顾一下，从我的头到我的脚，回想起这十样东西。我去做点事情，等你完成。我马上回来。好吧，应该给你足够的时间来复习所有内容了。让我们再过一遍，看看你是否记得。首先是头上的筷子。

Out of my ear was the chicken curry the Indian dish. On my eye was a hamburger. Out of my nose was some dough that I was pushing in. Out of my mouth was a very long and sexy bra.
从我的耳朵里流出的咖喱鸡是印度菜。从我的眼睛上是汉堡。从我的鼻子里是我正在压入的面团。从我的嘴里则是一副非常长的性感胸罩。

Out of my chin there was a dealer dealing out cards from a pack of cards. Then we go to my armpits. What was coming out of it? Cheerios. Out of my bellybutton, bang, like a gun. On my knees, martini glass with vodka in it. And then finally, on the floor the pan cooking stuff by my funky boots.
从我的下巴上有个发牌员正在发放扑克牌。从我的腋下流出的是什么？麦圈（Cheerios）。从我的肚脐里，砰，像枪一样的声音。膝盖上则是一个盛着伏特加的马提尼杯。最后，地上有一个锅，旁边是我时尚的靴子，锅里正在煮东西。

Now what on earth does any of that mean? What I had you memorize are the ten most populated countries in the world. Here's how. What was on my head? Chopsticks, China. Curry dish, India. Hamburger, America. Dough that you're pressing in, Indonesia.
那么，这些究竟意味着什么呢？我让你记住的是世界上十个人口最多的国家。来看一下：
头上的筷子代表中国。
耳朵里的咖喱菜代表印度。
眼睛上的汉堡代表美国。
鼻子里压入的面团代表印度尼西亚。

The bra, Brazil.
胸罩代表巴西。
Pack of cards, Pakistan. Cheerios, Nicheerio, Nigeria.
扑克牌代表巴基斯坦。麦圈代表尼日利亚。
Bangladesh. Where else do you get vodka, but in Russia. And finally, Pan Japan. So without looking at those pictures you can say, the ten most populated countries in the world. China, India, USA, Indonesia, Brazil, Pakistan, Nigeria, Nicheerio, Bangladesh, Russia, and Japan. Pretty easy, right? Check you out on the next video.
“砰”代表孟加拉国。在哪里能喝到伏特加？当然是在俄罗斯。最后，锅代表日本。

所以，在不看那些图像的情况下，你可以列出世界上十个人口最多的国家：

中国
印度
美国
印度尼西亚
巴西
巴基斯坦
尼日利亚
孟加拉国
俄罗斯
日本

非常简单，对吧？期待在下一个视频中见到你！



### 2-1 Week 2 Introduction



This week, we're going to be doing a little brain excavation to learn that focusing intently isn't always the best thing for optimal learning and mind shifting. We'll discover other valuable methods to enhance your learning. And we'll see some unbelievable feats people can accomplish using these techniques.

### 2-2 The Value of a Poor Memory


We sometimes fool ourselves about our good attributes with relation to learning. We think they're bad. We saw that with the race car brains verses the hiker brains. Being a slow hiker type thinker can give you an advantage because you can be less likely to jump to conclusions and more able to flexibly change your mind when you're wrong.
我们有时会对自己在学习方面的优点产生误解，认为它们是缺点。我们在“赛车大脑”和“徒步大脑”的对比中看到了这一点。作为一个慢速的徒步思考者，实际上可以让你更具优势，因为你不容易仓促下结论，并且在错误时更能灵活地调整自己的想法。

But there's another advantageous attribute that we often think is bad, and that is a poor memory. The reality is that a poor memory has a valuable side to it. Let's review the key idea. We know that the prefrontal cortex has roughly four slots of working memory. This means we can hold a maximum of about four neural chunks of information in those slots when we focus our attention. Chunks can be simple, like those related to numbers, the notes that form a musical chord, or words or phrases in a foreign language. If we've practiced enough, we can build more complex neural chunks that we can easily pull into working memory and work with. The neural chunks are kind of like ribbons of thought. These neural chunks can also relate to more complicated ideas, like longer portions of a song, or a more complex equation. As you can see, these neural sort of chunks, ribbons, can, with practice, involve incredibly complex activities. Experts have lots of well practiced neural chunks that they can easily bring to mind. The key idea here is that when you first look at something to try to figure it out, your working memory in your prefrontal cortex is working very hard. But once you've understood that something and practiced enough with it to form a solid neural pattern, you've created a neural chunk. That's like that ribbon that you can easily draw into one slot of working memory, leaving the rest of your working memory free for other processing. And this is why, once we've practiced enough, beginning since we were toddlers, as adults, we can think a single thought, like walk towards the door, and walk, which is actually a very complex maneuver, without even continuing to think about it. Some people have working memories like steel traps, whatever ideas come before them can be easily retained in their working memories. This can make it easier for them to understand complex topics and solve complicated problems. But other people, like say, me, have not so good working memories. They may get something in mind, but then, shiny, they get distracted, and then some of what they were thinking about falls out their minds. But when that something falls out, something else comes in. And that's where creativity comes to play. Those new ideas that come willy nilly into your mind can be the source of creative new thoughts. And in fact, as we know from research, those with poor working memories are often more creative. Do you have to work harder to keep up with the steel trap memory types? Sure, but you wouldn't want to trade the asset that your poor memory gives you, that is your creativity. But digging deeper, a poor working memory means something else. As it turns out, a poor working memory gives you an effective tool to figure out simpler ways to do things. It may take you a while to figure those things out, but when you do figure them out, you can sometimes see elegant simplifications and brilliant shortcuts  that a person with a strong working memory just doesn't have the motivation to figure out. There's more. Andrew Wiles, for example, is a mathematical legend who, after 358 years of efforts by some of the world's leading mathematicians, at last proved Fermat's last theorem, has pointed out that you often need forgetting, as well as remembering, to help you solve problem. Forgetting helps you get past previous mistakes you might have made. Andrew's less than perfect memory, in other words, helped him to solve one of the world's most difficult problems.
但还有另一个我们常常认为是缺点的有利特质，那就是记忆力差。实际上，差的记忆力也有其宝贵的一面。让我们回顾一下关键思想。我们知道，前额皮质大约有四个工作记忆的槽位。这意味着当我们专注时，最多可以在这些槽位中保持大约四个神经块的信息。神经块可以是简单的，例如与数字相关的、构成音乐和弦的音符，或是外语中的单词和短语。如果我们练习得足够多，就能构建出更复杂的神经块，轻松调入工作记忆并进行处理。

神经块就像思维的丝带。这些神经块也可以涉及更复杂的概念，例如较长的歌曲片段或更复杂的方程式。正如你所看到的，这些神经块、丝带经过练习后，可以涉及令人难以置信的复杂活动。专家们拥有许多经过良好训练的神经块，能够轻松回忆起来。这里的关键在于，当你第一次查看某事试图理解时，你的前额皮质中的工作记忆正在非常努力地运作。但一旦你理解了某事并进行了足够的练习以形成稳固的神经模式，你就创建了一个神经块。就像那条丝带，你可以轻松地将其调入工作记忆的一个槽位，留下其余的工作记忆空间用于其他处理。

这就是为什么，一旦我们进行了足够的练习，从幼儿时期开始，作为成年人，我们能够想到一个简单的想法，比如“走向门口”，并且能够走动，这实际上是一个非常复杂的动作，而无需继续思考。有些人的工作记忆像钢铁陷阱，无论面前出现什么想法，他们都能轻松记住。这让他们更容易理解复杂的主题并解决复杂的问题。但另一些人，比如我，工作记忆则不太好。他们可能会在脑海中保留某些东西，但突然间，被某个亮点分散了注意力，之前的想法就会消失。但当某个想法消失时，其他的想法会进入。这就是创造力发挥作用的地方。那些随意涌入脑海的新想法可以成为创造性新思维的源泉。事实上，研究表明，工作记忆差的人往往更具创造力。

你必须更努力地追赶那些记忆如钢铁陷阱的人吗？当然，但你不会想放弃你那种差记忆所带来的资产，那就是创造力。更深入地说，差的工作记忆意味着其他事情。事实证明，差的工作记忆为你提供了一种有效的工具，可以帮助你找到更简单的做事方式。你可能需要一段时间才能弄清楚这些事情，但当你搞明白时，你有时能够看到优雅的简化和聪明的捷径，而拥有强大工作记忆的人却没有动机去发现这些。

还有更多。比如，安德鲁·怀尔斯是一位数学传奇人物，经过358年的努力，世界上一些顶尖的数学家最终证明了费马大定理，他指出，解决问题时常常需要遗忘与记忆并存。遗忘帮助你克服之前可能犯下的错误。换句话说，安德鲁的记忆力并不完美，反而帮助他解决了世界上最困难的问题之一。

Remember, if you do have a poor working memory, you'll want to use memory tricks like the memory palace or learn to associate. For example, you can associate people's names with memorable images. In English, it turns out that we have the name Wanda. You can remember Wanda's name by imagining a magic wand. Or the name Phil, which sounds like the word fill in English, can be more easily remembered if you fill Phil's head with fizzy water. Putting motion into your visualization helps make things stick better in memory.
记住，如果你的工作记忆不好，你可以使用一些记忆技巧，比如记忆宫殿法或联想法。例如，你可以将人名与令人难忘的图像关联起来。在英语中，有个名字是 Wanda。你可以通过想象一根魔法棒来记住 Wanda 的名字。或者，名字 Phil 听起来像英语中的“fill”，你可以想象把气泡水灌满 Phil 的头，这样更容易记住。

在你的视觉化过程中加入动态元素，有助于更好地巩固记忆。

Mental tricks can be very powerful tools. We'll cover some more mental tricks in the videos to come. But just a bit of insight now. Whether you have a good, or a not so good working memory, get yourself into the habit of making mind dumps of information that you do not need to keep online in your working memory. Every time you think of an errand, or something you need to remember, rather than holding it in working memory, commit to writing it down in a notebook or any other trusted inbox.
心理技巧可以是非常强大的工具。在接下来的影片中，我们将介绍更多的心理技巧。但现在先提供一点见解。无论你的工作记忆好与坏，都要养成将不需要在工作记忆中保持的信息进行“脑力倾倒”的习惯。每当你想到一项任务或需要记住的事情时，与其将其保留在工作记忆中，不如承诺把它写在笔记本或任何其他值得信赖的收件箱里。



### 2-3 Meditation and Mindfulness – What to Look for

We hear a lot nowadays about meditation and mindfulness. So inquiring minds often want to know what effect meditation can have on learning. First, let's back up a step. What is meditation? It's really just a way of bringing about different modes of consciousness using a variety of different techniques. For example, meditators may close their eyes and repeat a mantra, control their breathing, or deliberately cultivate a certain emotional state.
如今我们经常听到有关冥想和正念的讨论。因此，很多人好奇冥想对学习会有什么影响。首先，我们先来澄清一下，什么是冥想？冥想实际上是一种通过各种不同的技术来实现不同意识状态的方法。例如，冥想者可能会闭上眼睛，反复念诵咒语，控制呼吸，或者故意培养某种情绪状态。

Scientific research on meditation is still in it's infancy. But researchers can sometimes classify meditation techniques into two different types that seem to be fundamentally different . Focused attention and open monitoring. Given what we've learned already, my guess that these two types of meditation relate to the two different types of basic modes of the brain uses to perceive the world, focused and diffuse. And you'd be right. Focused attention types of meditations such as mantra, sound or chakra meditation appear to help enhance focus mode type thinking, this kind of meditation sometimes seems to make people feel better. It can help reduce feelings of depression and anxiety, even while it builds concentration abilities. In contrast, open monitoring types of meditation such as, vipassana and mindfulness, appear to improve diffuse imaginative thinking. With open monitoring, we don't just focus on one thing. Instead we keep our attention open to all aspects of experience without judging or becoming attached to our thoughts. Now we know that diffuse mode thinking is more wide ranging, your thoughts  can bounce pretty much anywhere. Daydreaming happens in the diffuse mode, daydreaming not only gives rise to more random thoughts and connections that underpin creativity. It also helps you plan for the future, since your thoughts tend to wander towards what the future might bring, sounds great, right? Well, not entirely. The diffuse mode is also affiliated with anxiety and depression. Think about it this way. If your mind is bouncing all over the place, it can get drawn into worry  about, whoa, things that might go wrong.  Part of the reason that building your focusing abilities may help make you feel happier is that it appears to suppress the diffuse mode, while it builds the focusing mode. So what does all this mean? It means that meditation can have surprisingly different effects, depending on the type. It's all very complex, and researchers are far from sorting everything out yet. In the end, practices that encourage focusing can be a great benefit for learning. But having some daily time where your mind relaxes and wanders freely is also very important, particularly if you want to encourage creativity. From a practical standpoint then if you are a meditator you might try to avoid feeling you should always be steering your thoughts back into focus if you catch your mind wandering outside meditation sessions. This might be why people find the pomodoro technique so useful for combining creativity with productivity. It's a sort of working meditation. Up next, we'll look at some of the deeper aspects of the pomodoro technique.
关于冥想的科学研究仍处于初级阶段，但研究人员有时会将冥想技术分为两种看似根本不同的类型：专注注意和开放监测。根据我们已经学习的内容，我猜这两种冥想类型与大脑用来感知世界的两种基本模式——专注模式和发散模式有关，你是对的。

专注注意类型的冥想，如咒语、声音或脉轮冥想，似乎有助于增强专注模式思维，这种冥想有时还会让人感觉更好。它可以减少抑郁和焦虑的感觉，同时提高集中能力。相反，开放监测类型的冥想，如内观（vipassana）和正念，似乎能改善发散的想象性思维。在开放监测中，我们不仅仅专注于一件事，而是保持对所有体验方面的关注，而不去评判或依附于我们的想法。

我们知道，发散模式思维范围更广，思绪几乎可以随意跳跃。白日梦发生在发散模式中，它不仅能产生更多随机的想法和联系，从而推动创造力，还可以帮助你规划未来，因为你的思绪往往会游向未来可能带来的事情，听起来不错，对吧？但并非完全如此。发散模式也与焦虑和抑郁有关。想象一下，如果你的思绪到处乱跳，可能会陷入对可能出现的问题的担忧中。

提升专注能力可能有助于你感到更快乐的部分原因在于，它似乎抑制了发散模式，同时增强了专注模式。那么，这一切意味着什么？这意味着冥想的效果可能因类型而异，实际上非常复杂，研究人员还远未理清所有问题。最终，鼓励专注的练习对学习是有益的，但每天有一些时间让思绪放松和自由流动也是非常重要的，特别是如果你想鼓励创造力。

从实际的角度来看，如果你是冥想者，当你发现自己在冥想之外的时间思绪游荡时，尽量避免感到必须将思维重新引导回专注。这可能也是人们发现番茄工作法（Pomodoro Technique）如此有效的原因，因为它将创造力与生产力结合在一起，实际上是一种工作冥想。接下来，我们将探讨番茄工作法的一些更深层次的方面。



### 2-4 The Pomodoro Technique as Working Meditation

A common challenge to making a mindshift is something so simple we almost forget to think about it, procrastination. Of course, in our previous MOOC, Learning How to Learn, we already learned about how procrastination can arise. When you even think about something that you don't really want to do, it activates the brain's pain centers. The brain, naturally enough, tries to stop that negative stimulation, so it turns its attention to something else, anything else. The result? You feel better almost instantly. But you've also just procrastinated. We learned, as well, about, the Pomodoro Technique to help you tackle procrastination. Italian Francesco Cirillo devised this fiendishly clever method in the 1980s, and it's spread around the world since then. To do a pomodoro, just turn off all distractions, no little ringy dingies from our cell phones or computers and then set a timer for 25 minutes. Then you hold your focus on your work as intently as you humanly can for those 25 minutes.
一个常见的思维转变障碍是我们几乎忘记去思考的简单问题——拖延症。当然，在我们之前的慕课《学习如何学习》中，我们已经了解了拖延症是如何产生的。当你想到某件你并不想做的事情时，它会激活大脑的痛苦中心。大脑自然会试图阻止这种负面刺激，因此它会将注意力转向其他事情，任何事情。结果是？你几乎瞬间感觉好很多，但你也刚刚拖延了。

我们还学到了番茄工作法（Pomodoro Technique），这可以帮助你应对拖延。意大利人弗朗西斯科·西里洛在1980年代发明了这个极具巧妙的办法，至今已经传播到世界各地。使用番茄工作法，只需关闭所有干扰，不让手机或电脑发出铃声，然后设定一个25分钟的计时器。在这25分钟内，尽你所能专注于你的工作。

We're all human, and distracting thoughts will inevitably arise when we're doing a pomodoro. For example, sometimes I'll set the pomodoro timer for 25 minutes. Great, I'm all happy. And then 5 minutes into the pomodoro, I'll look up and suddenly realize that I've got 20 whole minutes left to do. My mind goes, I just can't do 20 more minutes! But what I do is I let that thought go right on by and then I return my focus to my learning or my work. If I catch myself absently checking my email, I gently stop as soon as I've realized what I'm doing. In fact, I'll often close my email program, and other programs, just to make it a little harder to check them.
我们都是人，在进行番茄工作法时不可避免会出现分心的想法。例如，有时我会设置一个25分钟的番茄钟，心里觉得很好。可过了5分钟，我抬头一看，突然意识到还有整整20分钟要做。我的脑海里会想：“我真没法再坚持20分钟！”但我会让这个想法悄然过去，然后将注意力重新集中在我的学习或工作上。如果我发现自己无意识地在检查邮件，一旦意识到自己在做什么，我会轻轻地停止这一行为。实际上，我通常会关闭我的邮件程序和其他程序，以增加检查它们的难度。

None of us has perfectly obedient minds, thank goodness, which means it's inevitable that distracting thoughts are going to arise. The thing is when you're doing a pomodoro, you don't want to try to push those thoughts away or tell yourself not to think those thoughts. Instead, you just want to acknowledge the distracting thought and let it go by as you return your attention to whatever you were focusing on. We've mentioned the first three components of the Pomodoro Technique, but there's actually a fourth. Once you're done with the pomodoro it's reward time.  You get to switch your attention for a while to whatever you want. You might listen to a favorite song, go to your favorite social media, watch a funny dance video, do a funny dance yourself, chat online with a friend. Or do something where you move around a little bit, straighten part of your room, walk to the kitchen to get some coffee or tea. The whole idea is to get your attention off whatever you've just been focusing on. In fact, you want to give the part of the brain you've just been using a bit of a break. This means the reward shouldn't involve similar types of tasks. For instance, if you've been writing a report then you don't want to go to Twitter or Facebook and continue writing, even if it's about a different subject. That would be kind of like taking a break from lifting heavy barbells instead by lifting boxes of books. You're still doing heavy lifting either way, which means you're not getting much of a break. And at the end of the day you'll find yourself getting much more tired. A great approach is, if you're doing mental work, try to instead do some kind of movement during your breaks, something where your brain can relax and your mind can do some wandering. All of this is very important because in the past we've always thought that learning only took place when we were focusing our attention on something. But we now understand that an important part of learning takes place when we're not focusing on something. In fact, to truly understand something we often need periods where we've switched our attention off the material we're trying to understand, because that's the time when we consolidate and make sense of the material. We're not consciously aware of this process, which is why we often don't realize how important this consolidation process is for learning, memory, and long-term creativity. We've heard from tens of thousands of learners in Learning How to Learn about how much they loved the Pomodoro Technique. People often ask, well, why 25 minutes?
我们都没有完全听话的心智，谢天谢地，这意味着分心的想法是不可避免的。当你在进行番茄工作法时，不要试图将这些想法推开或告诉自己不要去想它们。相反，你只需承认这些分心的想法，然后在将注意力重新集中到你正在专注的任务上时，让它们悄然过去。

我们提到过番茄工作法的前三个组成部分，但实际上还有第四个组成部分。一旦你完成了一个番茄时间，就是奖励时间。你可以暂时将注意力转向任何你想做的事情。你可以听一首喜欢的歌，浏览你喜欢的社交媒体，观看一段有趣的舞蹈视频，自己跳一段有趣的舞，或者和朋友在线聊天。你也可以做一些活动，比如整理房间的一部分，走到厨房拿点咖啡或茶。整个理念是将注意力从刚刚专注的任务中移开。事实上，你想给刚刚使用的大脑部分一些休息时间。这意味着奖励不应该涉及类似类型的任务。例如，如果你在写报告，那么就不应该去Twitter或Facebook继续写，即使主题不同。这就像是在举重的间歇中，转而去抬书箱，依然是在进行重体力劳动，这意味着你并没有得到真正的休息。最终，你会发现自己变得更加疲惫。

一个很好的方法是，如果你在进行脑力工作，试着在休息时进行一些活动，让大脑放松，让思维自由游荡。这一切都非常重要，因为过去我们一直认为学习只发生在我们将注意力集中在某件事上时。但我们现在明白，学习的重要部分实际上是在我们不专注于某事的时候发生的。为了真正理解某个概念，我们通常需要有一些时间，将注意力从我们试图理解的材料上移开，因为那是巩固和理解材料的时刻。

我们对此过程并不十分意识到，这也是为什么我们往往没有意识到巩固过程对学习、记忆和长期创造力的重要性。我们在《学习如何学习》中听到了成千上万学习者对番茄工作法的喜爱。人们常常问，为什么选择25分钟？

Remember that pain in the brain that pops up when we think about something we really didn't want to do? It seems that when we decide to go ahead and work on that task despite the pain, that pain often lasts about 20 minutes. In other words, doing a pomodoro helps you just get past the pain and into the flow of the work. I do have to admit, if I really get going and into the flow, I don't necessarily make myself stop at the end of a pomodoro session. I just keep going as long as it feels good, which, of course, is fine too. People often also wonder about how long the break should be between pomodoros. Well, this depends on you, and what you've got going on. Maybe it's final examination time, or you've got a massively important presentation to prepare for. In this case, you may only want to have maybe 3 to 5 minutes between pomodoros. But if you're not in such a crunch time, perhaps you can take 10 or 20 minutes. Some people set a pomodoro timer as a sort of, worst case I only have to do 25 minutes, sort of motivator. The pomodoro helps them to get started, but if they get into the flow, and are liking what they're doing, they won't necessarily quit at the end of the 25 minutes.
记住，当我们想到一些我们不想做的事情时，大脑中出现的那种痛苦吗？似乎当我们决定尽管感到痛苦也要继续进行那个任务时，这种痛苦通常持续约20分钟。换句话说，进行一个番茄时间帮助你克服这种痛苦，进入工作的流畅状态。
我确实得承认，如果我真的进入状态，流畅地工作，我并不一定会在番茄时间结束时强迫自己停止。我会继续进行，只要感觉良好，这当然也没问题。人们也常常想知道，番茄工作法之间的休息时间应该多长。这取决于你自己的情况，以及你正在进行的工作。也许这是期末考试时期，或者你正在准备一场非常重要的演讲。在这种情况下，你可能只想在番茄工作法之间休息3到5分钟。
但如果你并不是处于紧迫状态，也许可以休息10到20分钟。有些人会将番茄计时器设置为一种“最坏情况下我只需要做25分钟”的激励。番茄工作法帮助他们开始工作，但如果他们进入状态并喜欢自己正在做的事情，他们不一定会在25分钟结束时停止。

You might also ask, how do I get myself restarted doing a pomodoro once I've taken a break? This also depends a lot on you. Everyone's motivated differently. One motivator is to download an app onto your phone that gives you badges for each pomodoro you finish. People often enjoy collecting these badges each day, and you can set a goal for yourself, perhaps two pomodoros for work related to one topic, maybe three related to another, and so forth. There are also other motivators you can use. We'll talk about them in the next video. The Pomodoro Technique is, in reality, a powerful and actually enjoyable type of meditation through work. Smart learners make great use of this.
你可能还会问，在休息后我该如何重新开始进行番茄工作法？这在很大程度上取决于你自己。每个人的动机不同。一个激励方法是下载一个应用程序到你的手机上，这个应用可以为你完成的每个番茄时间颁发徽章。人们通常喜欢每天收集这些徽章，你可以给自己设定一个目标，比如在某个主题上完成两个番茄时间，在另一个主题上完成三个，依此类推。

你还可以使用其他激励方法。我们将在下一个视频中讨论这些。实际上，番茄工作法是一种通过工作进行的强大而愉快的冥想形式。聪明的学习者会充分利用这一点。



### 2-5 Getting Past Procrastination

The Pomodoro Technique is a powerful tool to help guard against procrastination. But it can also help to take a bit of a step back when you catch yourself procrastinating to look at the bigger picture. Researcher Piers Steel has analyzed many of the different motivators and demotivators of procrastination, which he's written about in his book, The Procrastination Equation. Basically, Steel has found that you get yourself motivated to perform a task. Say to, write a report for work or to prepare for an examination at the university when you expect a reward or success. So you want to do what you can to increase the expectancy of success and the certainty of being rewarded. You also get motivated when you value the task and the task is pleasant. So you want to do what you can to increase the value and the pleasantness of the task. But on the other hand, you get unmotivated to perform a task when you get distracted or lose focus when you're affected by impulsiveness. So you want to do what you can to remove distractions and maintain your focus. Steel's ideas were combined into a very helpful flow chart by program management analyst Alex Vermeer. Basically, to get a handle on procrastination, you want to notice when your procrastination. Be specific about what you're avoiding. And to get motivated you'll want to focus on one of the three areas we just mentioned to increase expectancy, to increase value, or to decrease impulsiveness. So, how would you, for example, increase value? Well, one way is to find a greater meaning in what you're working on. And you do that, for example, by setting and reviewing your major life's goals. And asking yourself how they connect with what you're doing. You might also find a way to get into the flow with the material. Make sure that what you're doing is not to tough, or too easy. And sometimes it helps to create a sense of competition. You can compete against yourself, against your colleagues or you can just turn what you're doing into a game in whatever way you'd like.
番茄工作法是一种强有力的工具，可以帮助抵御拖延。但当你发现自己在拖延时，稍微后退一步，看看更大的图景也是有帮助的。研究者皮尔斯·斯蒂尔分析了许多与拖延相关的动机和非动机因素，并在他的书《拖延方程式》中进行了详细阐述。

基本上，斯蒂尔发现，想要激励自己完成某个任务，比如写工作报告或准备大学考试，你需要期待某种奖励或成功。因此，你要尽可能提高成功的期望和获得奖励的确定性。同时，当你重视某个任务并觉得这个任务愉快时，也会激励你去做。因此，你要尽可能提高任务的价值和愉悦感。

另一方面，当你分心或失去专注，被冲动影响时，你会对完成某个任务缺乏动机。因此，你需要尽量消除干扰，保持专注。斯蒂尔的观点被程序管理分析师亚历克斯·范梅尔整理成了一个非常有用的流程图。基本上，要掌握拖延，你需要注意到何时开始拖延。具体明确你在回避什么。要激励自己，你需要专注于我们刚提到的三个领域之一：提高期望、提高价值或减少冲动。

那么，如何增加价值呢？一种方法是在你所做的事情中找到更大的意义。例如，通过设定和回顾你的人生主要目标，问问自己这些目标与自己正在做的事情有何联系。你也可以找到一种方法，让自己与材料融为一体。确保你正在做的事情既不太难，也不太简单。有时，创造竞争感也有助于提升动力。你可以与自己竞争，或与同事竞争，或者以你喜欢的任何方式把你正在做的事情变成一个游戏。

There's a lot more to Vermeer's chart of course. It's important to keep energized, maybe by moving around a little, splashing some cold water in your face, putting on a little low-key music. And again, it's also useful to create a reward for yourself. More generally, do what you can to keep your brain healthy. Add accountability, and find passion in what you're working on. Now, to increase your sense of expectancy. Remember that if you don't do anything, it guarantees failure. But this means you should pat yourself on the back when you succeed. It's also important to be inspired and to be sure to plan ahead as much as possible. Another helpful strategy is to log your procrastination habits, and check your mindset. Have you inadvertently told yourself you just don't have the talent instead of telling yourself you can develop the talent?
当然，范梅尔的图表还有更多内容。保持精力充沛很重要，可以通过稍微活动一下、往脸上泼点冷水、放一些轻松的音乐来实现。同样，为自己创造一个奖励也是非常有用的。更普遍地说，要尽量保持大脑健康。增加责任感，并在你所从事的工作中找到热情。

现在，为了提高你的期望感，请记住，如果什么都不做，那就注定会失败。这意味着当你成功时，应该给自己一个鼓励。同时，保持灵感也很重要，尽量提前做好规划。另一个有用的策略是记录你的拖延习惯，并检查你的心态。你是否无意中告诉自己没有才能，而不是告诉自己可以发展才能呢？

You can also work to reduce your impulsivity. The key here is to set a realistic goal and break it down into tiny little doable pieces. When you're working on one of those pieces, set a timer. If you can't do a 25 minute Pomodoro, just start with 5 minutes. Eliminate temptations and distractions like your phone or social media. Set up helpful routines and habits. Use goal reminders and make your goals visible, perhaps by putting them on your mirror so you can see them every morning. Stop trying to suppress distracting thoughts that pop up, instead acknowledge them and let them go right on by. And of course, keep track of your progress so you can feel good about your accomplishments.
你还可以努力减少冲动性。关键在于设定一个现实的目标，并将其拆分成小而可行的部分。当你专注于其中一个小部分时，设定一个计时器。如果你无法做到25分钟的番茄时间，可以从5分钟开始。消除诱惑和干扰，比如手机或社交媒体。建立有益的日常习惯和例行程序。使用目标提醒，让你的目标可见，例如把它们贴在镜子上，这样你每天早上都能看到。

停止试图压制那些突然出现的分心想法，而是承认它们并让它们悄然过去。最后，当然要跟踪你的进展，以便让你为自己的成就感到良好。

There's one more thing with relation to procrastination. When you're learning something, especially if it's new and difficult, it's not a good idea to procrastinate. Although you can sometimes really focus under the stress of impending deadline. That stress can also be uncomfortable and counterproductive, making it harder to learn something difficult. More than that, it takes time to grow the new neural synapses that form the foundation of any learning. This is why, as we've noted before, it's important to space out your learning, doing a little every day, rather than trying to cram it all in on one short deadline. Your brain can only grow so many new synaptic connections in a day. And you also need many days of learning, and accompanying nights of good sleep, in order to effectively consolidate the material you've been learning. If you try to cram your learning, you're laying a poor foundation. When the learning's easy, like at the beginning of a course you're taking, it can seem okay to procrastinate and cram. But gradually, as the course goes on, your weak foundation will start showing itself. You'll start to think you just don't have a knack for understanding the material when it isn't that at all. You actually just haven't put the time in to properly understanding and learning it. Sometimes, however, procrastination can be productive. This often relates to tasks where you're synthesizing information. For example, when I was writing the book, Mindshift in preparation for doing this MOOC, I was doing a lot of travel around the world, meeting learners and talking with researchers. If I'd started writing too early, I wouldn't have given myself the time I needed to properly gather enough information. I had to give myself time to make sure I collected enough of the right data before I started drawing conclusions. Believe it or not, some learner's biggest challenge is that they want to dive right into writing a report or solving a problem without doing proper preparation. So this kind of, productive procrastination, where you're gathering your knowledge base, is very important. In the end, if you feel overwhelmed by everything you've got to do, just focus on one thing, and keep track of what works best. Finally, remember to use the information in Alex's full flow chart and Piers Steel useful book. Happy Mindshift.
关于拖延症，还有一件事需要注意。当你学习某样东西时，特别是新且困难的内容，拖延并不是一个好主意。尽管有时在即将到来的截止日期压力下你能够集中精力，但这种压力也可能让人感到不适并适得其反，使学习变得更加困难。更重要的是，形成新神经突触需要时间，而这些突触是学习的基础。这就是为什么我们之前提到，分散学习是重要的，每天做一点，而不是试图在短时间内突击学习。你的大脑每天能建立的新突触连接是有限的，而你还需要多天的学习和随之而来的良好睡眠，以有效巩固你所学的材料。如果你试图突击学习，你是在打下一个不牢固的基础。

当学习变得轻松时，比如在你参加课程的开始阶段，拖延和突击似乎是可以的。但随着课程的进展，你那薄弱的基础会开始显露出来。你可能会觉得自己对理解材料没有天赋，实际上并不是这样。你只是没有投入足够的时间去正确理解和学习它。

然而，有时拖延可以是有益的。这通常与你在综合信息的任务有关。例如，当我为这门慕课撰写《思维转变》一书时，我四处旅行，拜访学习者并与研究人员交流。如果我太早开始写作，就无法给自己足够的时间来收集足够的信息。我必须确保自己收集到足够正确的数据，然后再开始得出结论。

信不信由你，一些学习者最大的挑战是他们想在没有适当准备的情况下直接开始撰写报告或解决问题。因此，这种有生产性的拖延，即收集知识基础，是非常重要的。最后，如果你觉得要做的事情让你感到不堪重负，那就专注于一件事，并跟踪什么方法最有效。最后，记得利用亚历克斯的完整流程图和皮尔斯·斯蒂尔的有用书籍。祝你思维转变愉快！



### 2-6 The Value of Procedural Fluency and Deliberate Practice

So I have to tell you about a former student of mine. He came up, stuck out a red marked quiz that he just flunked and he said, I just don't see how I could have done so poorly. I understood it when you taught it in class. Here's the problem. In Western education, at least, we've gotten so wedded to the idea that conceptual understanding is the golden key to learning, that we've ignored the fact that practice and repetition is an equally vital aspect of learning. It's that repeated banging away at it that ultimately can structure knowledge. Students themselves, including my former student, are fooled about how to learn effectively. In the past, for thousands of years the only way people thought learning happened was through memorization. People showed their learning mostly by just regurgitating what they'd memorized. Now, it's not like this didn't work at all. Otherwise, we'd never have the wonderful advances in the arts and sciences that we've seen in the last millennia. But of course, memorization isn't everything in learning.
我必须告诉你一个我以前学生的故事。他走过来，递给我一份标记为红色的测验卷子，显然他刚刚挂科，他说：“我就是不明白为什么我会做得这么差。我在课堂上理解得很好。”问题在于，至少在西方教育中，我们过于执着于“概念理解是学习的金钥匙”这一理念，以至于忽视了实践和重复同样是学习中至关重要的方面。正是这种反复的练习，最终能够构建知识。

学生们，包括我的这位前学生，对如何有效学习有误解。在过去的几千年里，人们普遍认为学习只通过记忆实现。人们主要通过复述他们记住的内容来展示他们的学习成果。当然，这种方法并不是完全无效的。否则，我们不会在过去千年中看到如此辉煌的艺术和科学进步。但当然，记忆并不是学习的全部。

As a reaction to that extreme sort of learning equals memorization idea, in the last 100 years or so, a new approach has gradually arisen in Western ways of teaching. This approach says that conceptual understanding, not rote learning or memorization, is the key to learning. But in the West, at least, we've now gone off on to the other end of the extreme. We've gone so far overboard in emphasizing the unique importance of conceptual understanding that we've lost sight of the fact that some memorization in practice, especially deliberate practice that focuses on the hardest parts of the material, is also important in any kind of learning. In fact, practice and repetition, not to mention memorization, don't just reinforce your understanding, they can actually lead to a deeper and richer understanding, as this paper shows. Poets often say, memorize the poem and you will understand it more deeply. But why should we in other disciplines let only the poets have all the fun? Memorizing an equation, for example, can help you understand that equation more deeply, especially if you're trying to understand what's going on with that equation as you're memorizing it. Unfortunately, you'll sometimes hear even advanced educators and educational psychologists in the West saying, it doesn't matter, you can always look it up, in regards many forms of learning, especially in math and science. But that's really not true. Would you know the French language, for example, if you had to go look words up every time you needed them? Would you know how to properly design an engine if you hadn't spent time memorizing some of the equations, or at least working enough with them such that they flowed fluently in your mind? Would you really want your doctor to breeze through medical school without memorizing any of the hundreds of thousands of facts doctors are typically asked to memorize during their preparatory studies? Psychologist Anders Ericsson's work has shown that all expertise develops through building strong, well practiced mental representations. That is, large libraries of solidly built neural chunks that can be easily drawn into working memory. The main point of this video is that practice, including some memorization, can help you to chunk key ideas and procedures, a vitally important part of learning. Remember how when you're first trying to figure something out, the working memory of your prefrontal cortex is going a little crazy? Of course, once you've got that concept chunked, that is, understood and practiced, you basically have the equivalent of a nice, smooth ribbon that you can easily bring into working memory whenever you need to, leaving the other slots of working memory free to process other related chunks to hook them together to form more advanced thoughts. This is a key idea.
作为对“学习等于记忆”这一极端观点的反应，在过去100年左右，西方教育方法逐渐出现了一种新的理念。这种方法认为，概念理解，而非死记硬背或记忆，是学习的关键。然而，至少在西方，我们现在又走向了另一个极端。我们在强调概念理解的独特重要性方面过于偏激，以至于忽视了某些记忆和实践，尤其是专注于材料中最困难部分的刻意练习，在任何形式的学习中同样重要。

实际上，练习和重复，甚至记忆，不仅能加强你的理解，还能导致更深入、更丰富的理解，正如这篇论文所展示的。诗人们常常说：“记住这首诗，你会更深入地理解它。”但为什么在其他学科中，我们只能让诗人们享受这样的乐趣呢？例如，记忆一个方程式可以帮助你更深入地理解它，尤其是当你在记忆时努力理解这个方程式的含义时。

不幸的是，有时你会听到甚至是高级教育工作者和教育心理学家在西方说：“没关系，你可以随时查找”，这对于许多形式的学习，尤其是数学和科学而言。但这并不完全正确。例如，如果你每次需要法语单词时都必须查找，你还会懂法语吗？如果你没有花时间记忆一些方程式，或者至少足够熟练地运用它们，使它们在你脑海中流畅地出现，你真的能正确设计一台引擎吗？你会希望你的医生在医学院期间毫无记忆地轻松通过，忘记那些医生通常在准备学习过程中需要记住的成千上万的事实吗？

心理学家安德斯·艾瑞克森的研究表明，所有的专业技能都是通过构建强大且经过良好训练的心理表征而发展的。这就是构建大量坚实的神经块的过程，这些神经块可以轻松调入工作记忆中。这个视频的主要观点是，练习，包括一些记忆，可以帮助你将关键概念和程序进行分块，这是学习中至关重要的一部分。

记住，当你第一次试图搞清楚某件事情时，你前额皮质的工作记忆有点疯狂吗？当然，一旦你将这个概念分块，即理解并进行实践，你基本上就有了一个光滑的“丝带”，可以在需要时轻松调入工作记忆，从而让其他工作记忆槽位可以处理其他相关的神经块，将它们结合在一起形成更高级的思想。这是一个关键思想。

If you want to see true procedural fluency, that is brilliantly chunked expertise in action, take a look at Mr. Kazuyuki Takayanagi, the president of Soroban Kyoshitsu USA, which is actually located in Japan, as he works with two young children who are learning to add numbers incredibly quickly in their heads using a technique called Flash Anzan It's almost impossible to believe that anyone could add that fast, much less young children, but add they can. What this means is that the rhythms of quickly practicing addition have formed fundamental neural structures that these children can access rapidly, easily, and largely subconsciously, which means that their conscious working memory can be working on more advanced ideas that build on the simpler ideas of addition. Some children can actually play verbal games while they're doing Flash Anzan because the verbal processing uses a different part of the brain. I sometimes have students come to me saying they suffer from test anxiety. Test anxiety does exist. I suffer from it myself. But after decades of teaching, I've come to realize that those who claim test anxiety often simply haven't studied well. Of course they feel anxious when they sit down to do a test. It's just that they haven't studied the material. Only when the test is put in front of them do they look deeply enough to realize that they didn't understand it, it's too late, and they panic. So remember, conceptual understanding is important, but equally important is practice and repetition enhanced by a healthy dose of memorization. I'm Barbara Oakley, happy Mindshift.
如果你想看到真正的程序流畅性，也就是出色的知识分块应用，可以看看高柳和之先生，他是位于日本的美国算盘教室（Soroban Kyoshitsu USA）的校长。他与两个正在使用一种叫做“Flash Anzan”的技术快速心算的孩子们一起工作。几乎令人难以置信的是，居然有人可以加得如此之快，更别提这些年轻的孩子们，但他们确实可以做到。这意味着快速练习加法的节奏形成了这些孩子能够迅速、轻松且主要是潜意识地访问的基本神经结构，这样他们的意识工作记忆可以处理建立在加法基础上的更高级的想法。

一些孩子在进行Flash Anzan时实际上可以玩语言游戏，因为语言处理使用了大脑的不同部分。我有时会有学生来找我，说他们有考试焦虑。考试焦虑确实存在，我自己也有过这种体验。但经过数十年的教学，我逐渐意识到，那些声称有考试焦虑的人，往往只是没有很好地学习材料。坐下来参加考试时，他们当然会感到焦虑。这仅仅是因为他们没有掌握材料。当考试摆在他们面前时，他们才会深入认识到自己没有理解，已经太晚了，于是感到恐慌。

所以，请记住，概念理解很重要，但同样重要的是通过健康的记忆练习和重复来增强学习效果。我是芭芭拉·奥克利，祝你思维转变愉快！



### 2-7 Bad Grades and Barb's Hands – The Value of Mental Tricks

So it was at age 26 when I started to try and retrain my brain from being a linguist to becoming more technical. I worked very hard at this, but I couldn't resist the opportunity to keep having adventures. A couple years into my brain retraining exercise, I had the opportunity to go to the Bering Sea and work as a Russian translator on Soviet trawlers. And then the unexpected opportunity arose for me to work as a radio operator at the South Pole Station in Antarctica. Exciting times, except for one thing. All this meant that I took about a year off from the electrical engineering program I just worked so hard to be accepted into. The semester I finally returned to the university after my adventures, it might be no surprise to learn that I struggled. I'd lost some of my newly acquired fluency with math and equations. After all, I'd been away for a year. When I got to my end of semester grades, I was distraught. In fact, I was so disappointed in myself, that I kept feeling upset and stressed for weeks. Have you ever noticed my hands? They've got, let's say, a kind of interesting twist to them. This is because when I let stressful emotions take over my life, I open myself up to disease. I was only 29 years old at the time, but right in the middle of my stressful reaction to bad grades, I acquired rheumatoid arthritis. Allowing yourself to react inappropriately to stressful events can open the door to serious disease, including not only rheumatoid arthritis, but even cancer. It's not like it's just a temporary thing. Obviously these kinds of diseases can affect you for the rest of your life or even shorten your life. Nobel Prize winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman makes a vital point when he observes nothing in life is as important as you think it is, while you're thinking about it. This is a very useful thought to keep in mind to help put your life into perspective. Unfortunate things happen to everyone. But if you react badly, you can end up making those things even worse. At that time, I just didn't have the cognitive tools I needed to be able to handle stress better. I didn't realize that simple mental tricks can be invaluable not only in reducing stress but also overall in helping me to be more effective, productive, and happy in my life and my learning. So what kinds of mental tricks am I talking about? First, let me give you a little background. Let's say you're visiting a zoo and you see a snake in a cage. No big deal right. But now let's imagine that you see that snake outside the cage slithering towards you, very different. You see, the context with which you view something makes an enormous difference. If you learn to put a mental cage, a better frame, around your stressful thoughts it can help you move forward in a positive way. Anyone can learn and develop mental tricks to help them reframe negative thoughts in a more positive way. In the next video, we'll learn some of the most powerful of these tricks.
在26岁时，我开始尝试将我的大脑从语言学家重新训练为更具技术性的思维。我为此付出了很多努力，但我无法抗拒继续冒险的机会。在我进行大脑重训练的几年来，我有机会去白令海，作为苏联拖网船的俄语翻译工作。随后，我意外地获得了在南极洲南极站担任无线电操作员的机会。那段时间很激动，除了一个问题。这一切意味着我从刚刚努力进入的电气工程项目中休息了一年。当我最终在经历了冒险后返回大学时，可能不出所料，我遭遇了困难。我失去了一些新获得的数学和方程式的流利度。毕竟，我已经离开了一年。当我看到学期末的成绩时，我感到非常沮丧。实际上，我对自己如此失望，以至于连续几周感到不安和压力。

你有没有注意到我的手？它们有点独特的扭曲。这是因为当我让压力情绪占据我的生活时，我就会让自己容易得病。那时我只有29岁，但在我因糟糕的成绩而产生的压力反应中，我得了类风湿性关节炎。让自己对压力事件反应不当可能会导致严重疾病的发生，包括类风湿性关节炎，甚至癌症。这并不是一时的事情。这类疾病显然可能影响你的一生，甚至缩短你的生命。诺贝尔奖获得者心理学家丹尼尔·卡尼曼指出，生活中没有什么事情在你思考时是那么重要的。这是一个非常有用的观点，有助于你更好地看待生活。每个人都会遭遇不幸的事情，但如果你反应不当，就可能使这些事情变得更糟。在那时，我并没有处理压力所需的认知工具。我没有意识到简单的心理技巧不仅可以显著减少压力，还能帮助我在生活和学习中更有效、更高效和更快乐。

那么，我所说的心理技巧是什么呢？首先，让我给你一些背景。假设你在动物园，看到一个蛇在笼子里。这没什么大不了的，对吧？但现在想象一下，你看到那条蛇在笼子外面朝你滑来，那就完全不同了。你看，观看事物的上下文差异很大。如果你学会给自己的压力思维加上一个心理笼子，一个更好的框架，就能帮助你以积极的方式向前推进。任何人都可以学习和发展心理技巧，帮助他们以更积极的方式重新构建消极思维。在下一个视频中，我们将学习这些技巧中一些最强大的方法。



### 2-8 Learning to Reframe – Put a Label on It!


So what could I have done in reaction to my personal setback with my grades, or with any kind of setback that could have made for a healthier outlook? Putting a label on your feelings, in other words, putting your feelings into a few brief words is one of the most helpful mental tricks you can use when you find yourself being emotionally upset. Applying a label forces you to put your emotional feelings into words. And moving feelings into words helps you shift your thinking from the emotional centers of your brain to the more rational parts of your brain, which automatically begins to tone down your emotions. Fortunately, a field called cognitive therapy has developed a checklist of common emotionally-based distortions of thinking. This checklist provides an automatic set of labels. You can look at these brief descriptive words that I'm going to give you and see which ones fit the emotions you might be feeling when you're upset. Once you've found the words for your feelings, voilà, you're already beginning to move your thoughts from emotions to more rational cognitions. Not only does this labeling start helping to calm you down, it also helps you to more easily see the distortions In your thinking. Here I'm going to give you some common cognitive distortions based on the list developed by Dr. David Burns and his great book, The New Mood Therapy. It's worth copying down these distortions and using them as labels to reflect on when something upsets you. Basically, when I felt badly about my grades, I was using every common cognitive distortion in the book. Let's review them one at a time.
那么，面对我成绩的个人挫折，或者任何类型的挫折，我可以采取什么措施来保持更健康的心态呢？给自己的感受贴上标签，换句话说，就是将自己的感受用简短的词语表达出来，这是当你情绪不安时可以使用的最有帮助的心理技巧之一。给情感贴标签迫使你将情绪感受用语言表达出来，而将情感转化为语言可以帮助你将思维从大脑的情绪中心转移到更理性的部分，这自动会开始减弱你的情绪。

幸运的是，一个叫做认知疗法的领域发展出了一份常见情感基础思维扭曲的检查表。这份检查表提供了一组自动的标签。你可以查看我将要给你的这些简短描述性词语，看看哪些与当你感到不安时可能经历的情感相符。一旦你找到了描述自己感受的词语， voilà，你已经开始将思维从情感转移到更理性的认知上了。这种贴标签的方法不仅有助于让你冷静下来，还帮助你更容易地识别思维中的扭曲。

接下来，我将给你一些基于大卫·伯恩斯博士在他的著作《新情绪疗法》中开发的常见认知扭曲。这些扭曲值得记下来，并在你感到不快时作为反思的标签。基本上，当我对自己的成绩感到不满时，我正好在使用书中列出的每一种常见的认知扭曲。让我们逐一回顾这些扭曲。

First, I was using all or nothing thinking. I felt if I didn't get good grades, I was a total failure. I mean, really. The reality was that I wasn't a total failure by any stretch of the imagination. Even if I'd flunked out of the university, I wouldn't have been a total failure. I was exploding the significance of that semester of poor grades. The reality was that even if I'd flunked out of school, and hadn't been successful at changing my brain to be able to effectively study math, I likely would've found a way to go on and have a successful and happy life.
首先，我使用了全或无思维。我觉得如果我没有取得好成绩，那我就是一个彻底的失败者。实际上，我并不是一个彻底的失败者，完全不应该如此想。即使我退学了，我也不会是一个完全的失败者。我当时夸大了那个学期不佳成绩的重要性。事实上，即使我退学了，且没有成功地改变自己的思维方式来有效学习数学，我仍然可能会找到一种方式继续过上成功和快乐的生活。

And then there's overgeneralization. I saw one semester's failure as part of a series of failures in my life. Sure, I'd done badly that semester, but I've done badly before. As when I'd been a failure as a signal officer in the military. But previously, I'd also done well at some things, like studying Russian. When I thought I was a failure, I simply wasn't looking at the bigger picture. I was overgeneralizing in thinking I'd always have bad grades. Remember Nobel Prize winning psychologist, Daniel Kahneman's point? Nothing in life is as important as you think it is while you're thinking about it. At that time, I felt like my life was a complete failure. I was obviously wrong. I was also using a mental filter. I was focusing on my one semester's poor grades and obsessing on them and forgetting about everything else. Here were all these good and beautiful things around me everywhere, and I was ignoring them. I was also discounting the positive. I'd worked hard and previously been able to get good grades. I had a wonderful husband who I'd met at the South Pole station in Antarctica. I had my good health. I was also jumping to conclusions. Somehow, in my mind, I was predicting that things would go badly from then on. The reality was that I didn't really know what was going to happen from then on out. I was also mind reading. Thinking that others were going to think badly of me. I really had no idea what other people, like my family, would think. I was falling victim to my own emotional reasoning. I assumed that just because I felt negatively about what had happened, that it really was a negative thing. Actually, my feelings had little to do with what was happening in the real world. The whole incident was equivalent to me feeling terrified of the airplane flight, and the flight was actually perfectly fine. I was telling myself I should have done better. Shouldy kind of thinking, these kinds of statements just aren't helpful. They lead only to guilt, anger, and frustration. I was also using pejoratives of myself. I was telling myself I was stupid, I was an idiot, and that what happened was absolutely terrible. This kind of name calling does no good at all. In fact, it makes you feel bad about yourself and also leaves you feeling angry and frustrated. What happened was unfortunate, but it wasn't terrible. In fact, getting a few bad grades really wasn't a big deal at all in the greater scheme of how my life unfolded. Sometimes we take blame and assume responsibility for errors we didn't make. Or we inappropriately blame others. In my case, I blamed myself for my bad grades. After all, I was to blame for getting away from my studies for a year. But did I really need to drag myself under the bus for having undertaken some great adventures? So we've gone over a list of labels you can use to move yourself from an emotionally based framework to a more rational, calmed down part of the brain where you can more carefully analyze and reason away the distortions in your thinking. In the discussion forum, you might want to mention something, anything that's been bothering you. Then describe what cognitive distortion or distortions you may be using. It might be many of them. Finally, look logically at the distortions you're using. What is the reality when you put things into a greater life perspective just as I've done with that past episode of my own life. Whenever you find yourself growing despondent, sit yourself down, think about what's really bothering you, go back through those labels, and see how your mind is tricking you. Then develop a rational response. You'll be surprised at how much better this can make you feel. There's one more trick you can use to help positively reframe. And that is to find positive ways to think about a negative experience. For example, if you failed at business, think of it as a great learning experience that many ultimately successful entrepreneurs have also had. If you didn't get the job you wanted, well, that's leaving you open for a better job ahead. And meanwhile, it's a great signal for you to upgrade your skills. Did poorly on an exam? Well, maybe that's a clue to examine your study habits. Your best friend dying of cancer? Well, maybe you want to focus on trying to improve the quality of the life your friend has remaining.
接下来是过度概括。我把一个学期的失败视为我生活中一系列失败的一部分。确实，我那学期表现不好，但我以前也曾表现不佳，比如在军队里当信号军官时的失败。然而，以前我也有一些做得不错的事情，比如学习俄语。当我觉得自己是个失败者时，我实际上没有看到更大的全局。我在过度概括，认为我将永远得不到好成绩。记住诺贝尔奖得主心理学家丹尼尔·卡尼曼的观点吗？在你思考的时候，生活中的事情没有什么比你想的更重要。那时，我觉得我的生活完全失败了，显然我错了。

我还使用了心理过滤。我只关注自己那一个学期的糟糕成绩，并对此感到痴迷，忽视了周围的其他一切。周围有那么多美好的事情，而我却选择忽略它们。我还在贬低积极性。过去我努力工作，能够获得好成绩。我有一个在南极站遇到的很棒的丈夫。我身体健康。我还在草率下结论。在我的脑海中，我预言接下来的事情会变得糟糕。现实是，我并不知道从那时起会发生什么。我还在进行心灵阅读，认为别人会对我有不好的看法。实际上，我对家人等其他人会怎么想根本没有概念。我成为了自己情感推理的受害者。我假设仅仅因为我对所发生的事情感到消极，那确实就是一件负面的事情。实际上，我的感受与现实世界中发生的事情关系不大。这整个事件就像我对飞行感到恐惧，而实际的飞行却完全正常。

我告诉自己应该做得更好。这种“应该”的思维方式并没有帮助，只会导致内疚、愤怒和挫折。我还在自我贬低，告诉自己我很愚蠢，是个傻瓜，所发生的事情简直太糟糕了。这种自我谩骂毫无益处。实际上，它只会让你对自己感到不安，并使你感到愤怒和沮丧。发生的不幸事情确实令人失望，但并不是可怕的。实际上，获得几个不好的成绩在我生活的更大框架中并不算什么。

有时我们会承担不必要的责任，或者不当地指责他人。在我的情况下，我把坏成绩归咎于自己。毕竟，我确实要为自己离开学习一年而负责。但我真的需要因为经历了一些伟大的冒险而惩罚自己吗？

所以，我们讨论了你可以使用的一系列标签，将自己从基于情感的框架转向大脑中更理性、更冷静的部分，在那里你可以更仔细地分析并理清思维中的扭曲。在讨论区，你可以提到一些让你烦恼的事情，然后描述你可能使用的认知扭曲。这可能是许多种。最后，从逻辑上审视你正在使用的扭曲。当你将事情放入更广阔的生活视角时，现实是什么，就像我对自己过去生活的那一集所做的那样。

每当你发现自己变得沮丧时，坐下来，想一想真正困扰你的是什么，回顾这些标签，看看你的思维是如何欺骗你的。然后制定一个理性的回应。你会惊讶于这样做能让你感觉好得多。还有一个技巧可以帮助你积极地重新构建思维，那就是以积极的方式看待负面经历。例如，如果你在商业上失败，可以把它视为许多最终成功的企业家也曾经历的宝贵学习经验。如果你没有得到你想要的工作，那就意味着你为未来更好的工作留出了空间。同时，这是一个很好的信号，提醒你提升自己的技能。如果你在考试中表现不佳，那也许是一个检查你学习习惯的线索。你的好朋友因癌症去世？那么，也许你想关注如何改善你朋友剩余生命的质量。

Positively reframing isn't just mental trickery. It extinguishes negative emotions that are arising from that fight or flight center of the amygdala. It seems that consciously finding a way to change the meaning of what's being experienced reduces the flood of stress-related neurotransmitters that are released by the hyper-vigilant amygdala. You might wonder what positive thing could possibly have come from my having rheumatoid arthritis? Simple, if it helps give you a visual reminder you can call to mind to help calm yourself down and reframe in the face of the stress that will inevitably arise in your life. I'll be back.
积极重新构建思维并不仅仅是心理技巧。它能够消除源自大脑杏仁核的“战斗或逃跑”中心所产生的负面情绪。似乎有意识地找到改变所经历事情意义的方法，可以减少由高度警觉的杏仁核释放的与压力相关的神经递质的涌现。你可能会想，从我得类风湿性关节炎中，可能有什么积极的事情呢？简单来说，如果它能帮助你提供一个视觉提醒，帮助你在生活中不可避免出现压力时冷静下来并进行重新构建，那么它就是有意义的。我会回来。



### 2-9 Integrate All Your Senses Into Learning – The Pitfalls of "Learning Styles"

There's a lot of misinformation out there about the concept of learning styles. To help keep you on track with your learning, I'd like to give you some quick insight into what researchers have found and what it means for you. People receive and process new information in different ways. Pretty much all researchers agree with that idea. But what supporters of learning styles theory propose is something more. That people learn best when information is presented in a person's preferred learning style. Visual learners for example would recall and understand better if they can see the material as opposed to audio learners who would recall and understand the material better, if they can hear the material. But here's what researcher Beth Rogowsky and her colleges had found when they carefully analyzed some of the most common learning styles. If you take a standardized adult learning style inventory that shows you're a visual learner, you actually don't do any better when you're reading the words, than if you hear the words. Likewise if you test out as an auditory learner, you don't learn any better when you hear the material as opposed to when you can see it. In other words, there is no statistically significant difference when it comes to the relationship between a learning style preference and instructional method for your ability to comprehend the materials. Not only has research shown then that targeting your best learning style, doesn't appear to help you learn better, it seems like relying on your preferred style weakens your ability to learn using other senses. For example, if you think you're an auditory learner and you try to focus on learning by listening, what that means is you're getting less practice with reading, using your eyes. But being able to read well is an important skill in today's world. In fact, if you're an auditory learner, that's what you think you are, and you catered to your supposed need for auditory materials, then you're actually undercutting your ability to learn using one of the most common and important ways that most people receive information, that is, using visual means. How are you going to do well on typical standardized test, for example, if you don't practice the highly visual art of reading.
关于学习风格的概念，有很多误导性的信息。为了帮助你更好地掌握学习，我想给你一些关于研究者发现的快速见解，以及这对你意味着什么。人们以不同的方式接收和处理新信息，几乎所有研究者都同意这一观点。但学习风格理论的支持者提出的观点更进一步。他们认为，当信息以个人偏好的学习风格呈现时，人们学习效果最佳。例如，视觉学习者如果能看到材料，会更好地回忆和理解，而听觉学习者则更好地理解和回忆听到的材料。

然而，研究者贝丝·罗戈斯基及其同事在仔细分析了一些最常见的学习风格后发现，如果你在标准成人学习风格调查中显示自己是视觉学习者，实际上在阅读文字时并不会比听到文字时表现得更好。同样，如果你测试出是听觉学习者，你在听到材料时也并不会比看到材料时学习得更好。换句话说，在学习风格偏好和教学方法之间，与理解材料能力之间的关系没有统计学上的显著差异。

研究表明，针对你最擅长的学习风格并没有提高学习效果，依赖于你的偏好风格反而削弱了你使用其他感官学习的能力。例如，如果你认为自己是听觉学习者，并试图专注于通过听觉学习，这意味着你就会减少用眼睛阅读的练习。但在当今世界，良好的阅读能力是一项重要技能。事实上，如果你是听觉学习者，认为自己是，并且迎合你对听觉材料的所谓需求，那么你实际上是在削弱自己使用大多数人获取信息的最常见和重要的方式之一——视觉方式的学习能力。例如，如果你不练习阅读这种高度视觉化的技能，你如何在典型的标准化考试中表现良好呢？

It seems we often learn best when we can integrate what we're learning using a lot of our different senses including hearing, seeing and perhaps especially being able to feel with our hands, like what you're hopefully doing right now, seeing me, listening to what I'm telling you and maybe even taking notes of it with a pen or pencil in your hand. And feeling the paper on your notebook.
我们似乎在学习时，能够整合多种感官——包括听、看，尤其是用手去感受时，效果最好。就像你现在可能正在做的，看到我，听我告诉你的内容，也许还用手中的笔或铅笔做笔记，感受笔记本上的纸张。这种多感官的学习方式能够增强我们的理解和记忆。

Learning styles forms a big industry. Authors and companies make a lot of money from the tests they devise, administer, and teach workshops about. So there's a big push to the idea that teaching to learning styles is important, even if there's a lack of scientific evidence for these claims, and even if teaching to learning styles can actually be harmful. So, a word to the wise, whenever you're learning something, try to take advantage of all of your senses. Don't characterize yourself as just having one preferred learning style. Instead think of yourself as an all inclusive type learner, you'll learn so much better as a result.
学习风格形成了一个庞大的产业。作者和公司通过设计、实施测试和教授研讨会赚取了大量利润。因此，有一种强烈的趋势认为，按照学习风格进行教学是重要的，尽管对此的科学证据缺乏，甚至按照学习风格教学可能会产生负面影响。因此，建议你在学习任何东西时，尽量利用所有的感官。不要把自己定义为仅有一种偏好的学习风格。相反，认为自己是一个全面的学习者，这样你将能获得更好的学习效果。



### 2-10 Can You Try to Learn Too Much?

In this video, we're going to explore a question that many educators find a little bit uncomfortable. Can you try to learn too much? Ana Belen Sanchez-Prieto, professor of medieval manuscript studies and archive management in Madrid gives interesting insight about this. Ana had her doubts about online education, but when she was given the opportunity to teach a MOOC, she decided to do some exploration to get a better understanding of the online world. Since Ana was going to create an online class, she wanted to try one out herself first. I took the MOOC, Archaeology's Little Dirty Secrets And I loved it. It gave me a lot of ideas for my own online class. But I also learned that I had a lot to learn about effective teaching, so I enrolled in another MOOC, Foundations of Teaching for Learning. Then I took the complete specialization. Then I took every education-related MOOC I could find. But then, I began to discover that I could take MOOCs on things I wondered about but have never had the chance to learn, such as computers. Dr Chuck's classes on the Internet and Python were fantastic eye openers. Then I started taking classes on HTML and other tools for web development. Then I started working my way through math with Khan Academy. I'll be honest, I got carried away.
在这段视频中，我们将探讨一个许多教育工作者觉得有些不舒服的问题：你能否学习过多？马德里中世纪手稿研究与档案管理教授安娜·贝伦·桑切斯-普列托对此提供了有趣的见解。安娜对在线教育持有怀疑态度，但当她获得教授慕课的机会时，她决定进行一些探索，以更好地理解在线学习的世界。由于安娜要创建一个在线课程，她想先尝试一个。

于是，我参加了名为《考古学的小秘密》的慕课，我非常喜欢这个课程。它给了我很多关于自己在线课程的灵感。但我也意识到我在有效教学方面还有很多要学习的，所以我注册了另一个慕课，《学习的基础》。然后我完成了整个专业课程，接着参加了我能找到的所有与教育相关的慕课。

然而，我开始发现我可以参加我感兴趣但从未有机会学习的课程，比如计算机。查克博士关于互联网和Python的课程让我大开眼界。接着，我开始学习HTML和其他网页开发工具。然后，我开始通过可汗学院学习数学。老实说，我有些沉迷于这种学习。

It caused real stress because I also have my own classes. My social life began vanishing. Finally, I have to face it, I was addicted to MOOCs and what is worse? I often wasn't really learning because I was focused more on finishing and getting the certificate. In the end I realized that many things can be interesting to learn about, but I had to choose.
这导致了真正的压力，因为我还有自己的课程。我的社交生活开始消失。最终，我不得不面对这个事实，我对慕课上瘾了，甚至更糟的是，我常常并没有真正学习，因为我更关注的是完成课程和获得证书。最后，我意识到，虽然许多事情都很有趣，但我必须做出选择。

A few months after her cold turkey withdrawal from MOOCs, Ana went back to MOOCing but this time she took a more balanced approach. She started sitting in on a MOOC on game design so she can apply gaming techniques to improve her classes. She's planning to repeat the gaming class again before formally enrolling, so she really learns the material. Ana's objective now is simply to learn but not to be overwhelmed and in the end Ana's MOOC, Deciphering secrets:The illuminated Manuscripts of Medieval Europe finally launched.
几个月后，在彻底戒掉慕课后，安娜又开始上慕课，但这次她采取了更平衡的方法。她开始旁听一门关于游戏设计的慕课，以便应用游戏技术来改善她的课程。她计划在正式注册之前再次参加游戏课程，以确保自己真正掌握材料。安娜现在的目标很简单，就是学习，而不是感到不堪重负。最终，安娜的慕课《解读秘密：中世纪欧洲的彩绘手稿》成功推出。

But Ana's path to balance inner life and her learning be a guide for you. Happy balanced mindshift.
但安娜在平衡内心生活与学习的过程中所走的道路可以成为你的指引。祝你拥有愉快而平衡的思维转变！


### 2-11 Your Social Brain

Who you hang out with strongly influences who you are. You will behave with more decorum in a group of serious scholars than with a group of drinking buddies. A colleague at Oxford University married a Danish woman once, and he told me his relationship with his wife changed once he learned Danish. They fell in love with each other speaking English. He wanted to learn Danish so he could get to know her better. When he spoke to his wife in Danish, he discovered she was a different person, and they fell out of love. Different languages, different personalities. Google once did an in-depth study to find out what factors went into making a successful team. Were the best teams made up of people with similar interests? Did it matter whether everyone was motivated by the same rewards? How often did teammates socialize outside their office? Did they have the same hobbies? Were their educational backgrounds similar? Was it better for all teammates to be outgoing, or for all of them to be shy? They started Project Aristotle to find out, and what they discovered was that none of these factors predicted success. For example, some successful teams had similar backgrounds, but others came from different backgrounds. Finally, they hit on one factor that predicted how well teams innovated. They called the factor "psychological safety". What was important was that the members of the team felt comfortable taking risks and sometimes failing. This encouraged team members to have interpersonal trust and to mutually respect everybody, feeling comfortable being themselves. The most successful teams had the most empathy. If you want to be successful working together with others, seek out those who are socially sensitive and can empathize with each other. Empathy can be enhanced by chemicals that affect brain chemistry. Ecstasy is a popular psychoactive drug taken at parties to enhance sociality. It produces a sense of well-being and happiness, including feelings of closeness with others, increased emotionality, enhanced sensation, and a sense of inner peace. Ecstasy causes a massive release of serotonin in the brain. Serotonin is one of the major neurochemical messengers found in the brain of every vertebrate, including ours. Neurons in the brain stem that manufacture serotonin project widely, influencing billions of neurons in the cerebral cortex - the most highly evolved part of the human brain. But there is also a downside to taking Ecstasy. Ecstasy releases most of the available serotonin in the brain and you become withdrawn, less social, for weeks that it takes to fully replenish your supply of serotonin. Prozac, a drug that is effective in treating some types of depression, also increases serotonin activity in humans by blocking the re-uptake of serotonin by neurons. Even many who do not suffer from clinical depression find that it lifts their mood, making them feel self-confident and more sociable. In contrast to Ecstasy, however, those who take Prozac only begin to feel better about themselves after many weeks of taking it, and the effects last much longer. Ecstasy, by contrast, alters serotonin levels very rapidly and depletes its stores, whereas Prozac causes a slower and longer term buildup in serotonin activity. Brain serotonin levels depend heavily on the environment. Lack of maternal care in nonhuman primates leads to reduced levels of serotonin, greater aggression, more alcohol consumption, and more anxiety-like behaviors during adolescence. Low levels of serotonin in stressed brains can make for a chemical tripwire for extreme and unpredictable violence. Low serotonin levels also spark a cycle of aggressive behavior and social illiteracy that sets up a child for school failure and peer rejection. Inmates in jail for violent crimes have some of the lowest levels of serotonin activity in society. Your social brain is swimming in a sea of neuromodulators, like serotonin, that affect your temperament. The set points are determined during development, and depend on early experience, but they can be changed by moving to a new environment, where you are surrounded by different people. Choose friends and coworkers who have aspirations that fit into your goals.
你和谁交往会强烈影响你是谁。在一群严肃学者中，你的行为会更加端庄，而在一群喝酒的朋友中，你的行为可能就会随意得多。牛津大学的一位同事曾经娶了一位丹麦女性，他告诉我，当他学会丹麦语后，他和妻子的关系发生了变化。他们最初是用英语相互爱慕的。他想学习丹麦语，以便更好地了解她。当他用丹麦语和妻子交流时，他发现她变成了一个不同的人，他们的爱也随之减退。不同的语言，塑造不同的个性。

谷歌曾进行过一项深入研究，以了解成功团队的组成因素。最佳团队是由兴趣相似的人组成吗？每个人是否被相同的奖励所激励，这重要吗？队员们在办公室外社交的频率有多高？他们有相同的爱好吗？教育背景是否相似？所有队员都是外向型人，还是都是内向型人，哪个更好？他们启动了“项目亚里士多德”来探究，发现这些因素都无法预测成功。例如，一些成功的团队背景相似，而其他团队则来自不同的背景。

最终，他们找到了一个能够预测团队创新能力的因素，他们称之为“心理安全”。重要的是团队成员感到舒适，能够冒险并在某些情况下接受失败。这鼓励了团队成员之间的相互信任和尊重，使大家能够舒适地做自己。最成功的团队拥有最多的同理心。如果你想与他人合作取得成功，就要寻求那些具有社会敏感性、能够相互理解的人。

同理心可以通过影响大脑化学的化学物质得到增强。摇头丸是一种在派对上流行的精神活性药物，用于增强社交性。它产生幸福感，包括与他人亲近的感觉、情感的增强、感觉的提升和内心的宁静。摇头丸会在大脑中大量释放血清素。血清素是每个脊椎动物（包括我们）大脑中发现的主要神经化学信使之一。制造血清素的脑干神经元广泛投射，影响大脑皮层中数十亿个神经元——人类大脑中最高度进化的部分。

但是，服用摇头丸也有其缺点。摇头丸释放了大脑中大部分可用的血清素，使你在几周内变得孤僻、社交能力减退，直到血清素水平完全恢复。百忧解（Prozac）是一种有效治疗某些类型抑郁症的药物，它通过阻止神经元对血清素的再摄取来增加人类的血清素活性。即使许多没有临床抑郁症的人也发现它能够提升他们的情绪，让他们感到自信和更具社交能力。然而，与摇头丸不同，服用百忧解的人通常需要在服用几周后才能感受到自我改善，且效果持续时间更长。相比之下，摇头丸迅速改变血清素水平并耗尽其储备，而百忧解则导致血清素活性的缓慢而长期的增加。

大脑中的血清素水平在很大程度上依赖于环境。在非人类灵长类动物中，缺乏母性关怀会导致血清素水平降低，攻击性增强，酒精消费增加，以及青春期出现更多焦虑样行为。压力较大的大脑中的低血清素水平可能会成为极端和不可预测暴力行为的化学导火索。低血清素水平还会引发攻击性行为和社会无知的循环，这会使孩子在学校失败并被同龄人排斥。因暴力犯罪而入狱的囚犯在社会中通常血清素活性最低。

你的社交大脑浸泡在诸如血清素等神经调节剂的海洋中，这些物质影响着你的气质。设置点是在发展过程中决定的，取决于早期经验，但通过转移到一个新环境中，身边的人群不同，它们是可以改变的。选择那些有抱负并与你的目标相符的朋友和同事。



### 2-12 Week 2 Wrap Up

We've had a lot of fun this week going deeper into what's needed to learn effectively. We reviewed some useful tricks like the Pomodoro Technique to help you keep your focus on what you're trying to learn or accomplish. Increasing your expectancy of success, your feelings about the value of the task and removing distractions are also important ways of improving your ability to retain focus. But we also found that, perhaps surprisingly, you don't always want to keep your focus on your learning. In fact, a valuable part of any learning process involves stepping back after periods of intent focus. Allowing more diffuse mode consolidation to take place involving whatever you're trying to master.
本周我们深入探讨了有效学习所需的要素，感到非常愉快。我们回顾了一些有用的技巧，例如番茄工作法，这有助于你保持对学习或完成任务的专注。提高成功的期望值、对任务价值的感受，以及消除干扰，也是提高保持专注能力的重要方法。但我们也发现，或许令人惊讶的是，你并不总是需要将注意力集中在学习上。实际上，任何学习过程中的一个宝贵部分就是在专注一段时间后退后一步，让更为广泛的模式巩固得以进行，这涉及到你所尝试掌握的内容。

We can also better prepare our brains for the type of discovery we want to do in our lives by choosing the appropriate form of meditation. Focused attention types of meditation enhances our ability to focus and can calm our brain. While open monitoring types seem to enhance our creative abilities. Gaining expertise at anything doesn't just involve understanding the concept, it also involves, practice, repetition, and yes, even some memorization. You want to feel so comfortable with key concepts that you don't have to even think about them, you can just use them. This kind of understanding means building neural chunks. That is, well connected neural patterns that you can draw to mind when you need them, much like computer sub-routines. This approach to learning can lead to extraordinary results. Procrastination can be productive, if you're using that time to synthesize information you're gathering or have already gathered. But don't fool yourself into thinking that procrastination is quite all right when you're learning or trying to understand something new, especially if it's difficult. New thinking involves growing new neural connections and that takes time.
我们还可以通过选择合适的冥想形式来更好地为自己生活中的探索做好准备。专注注意力的冥想类型增强我们的专注能力，并能够平静我们的思维，而开放监控类型的冥想似乎增强了我们的创造力。在任何领域获得专业知识不仅仅涉及理解概念，还需要实践、重复，甚至一些记忆。你希望对关键概念感到如此熟悉，以至于无需思考，就能轻松运用。这种理解意味着建立神经块，即能够在需要时提取的良好连接的神经模式，类似于计算机的子例程。这种学习方法可以带来非凡的成果。

如果你利用拖延时间来综合你正在收集或已经收集的信息，那么拖延可以是富有成效的。但不要自欺欺人地认为在学习或尝试理解新事物时，特别是当它很困难时，拖延是完全可以接受的。新的思维涉及到生长新的神经连接，而这需要时间。

We also learned that restricting yourself to one preferred learning style is a bad idea. Try to learn using many approaches. Your eyes, your hearing, your hands, and of course, your imagination through metaphor. It's also a good idea to use common sense in your learning. Don't take on too much or it can suck the joy from the experience. A great way to make learning and actually anything you do, more fun, is to hang out or work with the right group of people who will support you in positive ways. Mental tricks can be invaluable in helping us to reframe seemingly bad occurrences so that we can minimize our stress and reduce the bad effects that stress can have not only on our mental health but on our physical health. Putting a label on your feelings is one of the most helpful mental tricks you can use when you find yourself emotionally upset. We learned many of the common ways that our mind can mentally distort the reality of what's going on. Reframing to put a better light on whatever's causing you stress in your life isn't just mental trickery. Reframing extinguishes negative emotions arising from the fight or flight center of the amygdala. That sums things up this week in mindshift. Next week, we're on to learning and careers. Whatever stage you are in life, whether starting out, mid career, or in retirement, you'll find there's a lot there for you. And as you'll see, sometimes your worst traits can be your best traits.
我们还了解到，局限于一种偏好的学习风格是一个坏主意。尝试使用多种方法进行学习。运用你的视觉、听觉、触觉，当然还有通过隐喻发挥你的想象力。运用常识进行学习也是一个好主意。不要承担过多的任务，否则可能会削弱学习的乐趣。让学习和你所做的任何事情更加有趣的一个好方法是，与那些能够以积极方式支持你的人在一起工作或交往。

心理技巧在帮助我们重新构建看似糟糕的经历方面是非常宝贵的，这样我们就能减轻压力，并减少压力对心理健康和身体健康的负面影响。给情感贴上标签是你在情绪不安时可以使用的最有帮助的心理技巧之一。我们学习了许多思维如何扭曲现实的常见方式。重新构建，把压力源重新审视，以更积极的方式看待生活中的问题，不仅仅是心理技巧。重新构建能够消除来自杏仁核“战斗或逃跑”中心的负面情绪。

本周的内容就总结到这里。下周，我们将讨论学习与职业。无论你处于人生的哪个阶段，无论是刚起步、职业中期，还是退休，你都会发现有很多适合你的内容。而且，正如你将看到的，有时你最糟糕的特质可能反而是你最好的特质。



### Optional Bonus Video: Interview with Singapore Entrepreneur Adam Khoo

It's such pleasure to be here with you, today, Adam. And I have to start by just asking you some questions about the Singapore school system, and also about the education system in general and in Asia. Can you give us a little bit of context about what that system is, and what does it mean if you fall off track early on? Sure, so the education system in Asia, especially Singapore, is extremely competitive because most parents want their children to go to the top universities, and to qualify for top courses like medicine, law, engineering. Because they believe that that's the ticket to a better life, that's the ticket to success in life. And so because of the limited places, the truth is less than 10% of every cohort can make it to those courses. So if you don't get straight As, you don't stand a chance, so everyone's really pressured to do well. In fact, in places like India, they compete at a decimal point level. So if you get 99%, it's not good enough, you have to get 99.9% or 99.8%. And so as a result, parents spend hundreds of dollars, or even thousands of dollars, sending their children to tuition supplementary classes to just give them the competitive edge. And at a very young age of nine years old, in grade three, they're already streamed, based on their grades for the first three years. So the good students go to the gifted program, the special course, and the average students go to the express course, and the below average will then go to the normal stream, or the normal technical stream. So if you go to a good course, you get more challenging questions, you get more resources. You go to the less able course, again, less resources, less challenging questions. So at a young age, you already start to create that belief in yourself that I'm not as good as someone else, and it's a pressure to perform to get to a better course. If not, you're label as you can never make it to a good course.
今天能和你在一起真是太高兴了，亚当。我想先问你一些关于新加坡教育系统以及亚洲教育系统的一般问题。你能给我们提供一些关于这个系统的背景信息吗？如果在早期偏离了轨道，那意味着什么？

当然，亚洲的教育系统，尤其是新加坡，竞争非常激烈，因为大多数父母希望他们的孩子能进入顶尖大学，学习医学、法律、工程等热门专业。他们相信，这些专业是通往更好生活和成功的钥匙。因此，由于名额有限，实际上不到10%的学生能进入这些专业。如果你不能取得全A的成绩，你就没有机会，因此每个人都面临着巨大的压力。事实上，在印度等地方，竞争激烈到小数点的水平。如果你的成绩是99%，那还不够，你必须达到99.9%或99.8%。

因此，父母花费数百甚至上千美元让孩子上补习班，以帮助他们获得竞争优势。而在九岁时，三年级的学生已经根据前三年的成绩进行分流。优秀的学生进入天才班和特别课程，普通学生进入快速课程，低于平均水平的学生则进入普通课程或普通技术课程。进入好的课程意味着你会面临更具挑战性的问题和更多的资源，而较差的课程则相应地资源较少，问题较简单。

因此，在很小的年纪，你就开始在内心建立这样的信念：自己不如其他人，并且面临着必须表现出色以进入更好课程的压力。否则，你就会被贴上“无法进入好课程”的标签。

So this brings us exactly to our next question. You were expelled early on for misbehavior from elementary school, and then you were at the bottom of your class. You ended up what, bottom 10 out of 160 students? Yeah. And that was in secondary school. So at that time, you were convinced you were a complete loser, and that you could never be as good as the other students, and why even try. Yep. So what turned you around?
这正好引出了我们的下一个问题。你在小学时因为不良行为被开除，后来在班级里成绩也很差，最后在160名学生中排名倒数第10对吧？是的，那是在中学时。所以那时候，你坚信自己是个彻底的失败者，认为自己永远也无法比得上其他学生，干脆不如尝试。没错。那么，是什么让你改变了这种看法呢？

Yeah, so it was really out of desperation because my dad tried everything. He scolded me, he nagged at me, he sent me for all this extra tuition, but nothing worked. I know how to study, right? I wouldn't listen to anyone. In desperation, he sent me to this motivational program for students that was supposed to change mindsets and change our lives around, and it really helped. And the thing that really made an impact on me was, I learned about the power of beliefs, about the beliefs about what I could or could not do about what was possible or what was not possible for me. It changed my beliefs about how I saw myself. because in the past, I saw myself again, like you said, as a loser, right? Because everyone told me that. My teachers would say, why are you so lazy? My father would say, what's wrong with you? Why you keep forgetting everything? So when I went for this course, it began to get me to change how I saw myself. See, I used to believe that if other people can do something, I can't do it, because they're smarter than me, they're better than me, they're luckier than me. But when I went through this program, it taught me about the power of positive thinking, that we all have the same potential. As human beings, we've got tremendous potential, we just don't make full use of it, and we are all gifted in our own way. We all have the same potential, if we learn how to unleash that potential, that if someone can do something, so can I. It's just a question of how, it's a question of strategy. And the other powerful belief I learned was that for things to change, I had to change. See, previously, the belief was that for things to change, my teacher had to change, the exam had to change, right? So number one was the change of belief. Number two, I learned that the reason I couldn't remember well, or I could not do well, and studies were stopped because I was stupid or slow, was because I was using an ineffective learning strategy. So I began to learn how to learn at the time. For example, how to read more effectively, how to gather information by finding key words, how to make notes in a way that access my creativity. because I love drawing, I love singing, but I got bored very easily. So I learned how to draw mind maps, where I use pictures, I use colors to make boring subjects come alive. And I learned powerful, mnemonic techniques, how to memorize 30 words, 50 words in sequence by visualizing, associating, using sounds and movement. When I started learning all these things, I got excited because for the first time, I could remember a whole list of words. For the first time, I could remember an entire chapter in just a few minutes, using graphic organizers like mind maps.
是的，这真的源于绝望，因为我父亲尝试了所有办法。他骂我、唠叨我，还让我上了许多补习班，但都没有效果。我知道怎么学习，但我根本不听任何人的话。在绝望中，他把我送到一个旨在改变心态和人生的激励课程，结果真的对我有所帮助。对我影响最大的事情是，我了解到信念的力量，关于我能做什么或不能做什么，以及对我来说什么是可能的，什么又是不可能的。这改变了我对自己的看法，因为过去我把自己看作失败者，就像你说的那样。每个人都告诉我这样。我的老师会说：“你怎么这么懒？”我父亲则问：“你怎么了？为什么总是忘记一切？”

所以，当我参加这个课程时，它开始让我改变对自己的看法。以前，我相信如果其他人能做到的事情，那我就做不到，因为他们比我聪明、比我更优秀、比我更幸运。但当我参加这个课程时，它教会了我积极思维的力量，我们每个人都有相同的潜力。作为人类，我们具备巨大的潜力，只是我们没有充分利用它，而我们每个人都有自己独特的才能。如果我们学会如何释放这种潜力，如果别人能做到的事情，我也能做到。这只是一个如何做到的问题，是一个策略的问题。

另一个我学到的重要信念是，要改变事物，我自己必须先改变。之前我的信念是，要改变事物，老师必须改变，考试必须改变，对吧？所以首先是信念的改变。其次，我了解到我无法很好地记忆或学习不好的原因，并不是因为我笨或反应慢，而是因为我使用了无效的学习策略。因此，我开始学习如何学习。例如，如何更有效地阅读，如何通过寻找关键词来收集信息，如何以便于激发创造力的方式做笔记。因为我喜欢绘画和唱歌，但很容易感到无聊。所以我学会了画思维导图，利用图片和颜色让枯燥的学科变得生动。我还学习了强大的记忆技巧，如何通过视觉化、联想、运用声音和动作来记住30个词、50个词的顺序。

当我开始学习这些东西时，我感到兴奋，因为第一次我能记住整整一系列的单词。第一次，我能够在几分钟内记住整整一章，使用像思维导图这样的图形组织工具。

And the third thing I learned was really about how to dream big, how to set goals. I learned that motivation is motive plus action, that the reason I was not motivated was because I had no motive, I didn't know why I was studying. See, in the past, my father would say, and what grades are you going to get for exams? And I said I don't know, just pass. And he said, that's all? And I said, as long as I don't feel it's good enough. And he would look at me and say, Adam, five years from now, where will you be? And I'd say, I'll be at home. And he'd say, where will you be in life? I'd say, I don't know, all right? So when you don't have a goal or a compelling dream, you get lost, you get distracted by everything around you. So I learned from the program that to be motivated, I gotta have a motive, I gotta have a why. I'm not studying for my parents, I'm not studying for my teachers, I'm studying for me. So why should I study, all right? So I begin to learn to set goals about what I wanted to achieve in life. And one of the most powerful things I learned from my teacher at that time was that if you want to be exceptional, you have to set goals that challenge you, that stretch you off your comfort zone. So I set a goal to top my school in one year, to get to Victoria Junior College, which was one of the top junior colleges in Singapore. To get to the National University of Singapore, and to get a business faculty, which everyone thought was impossible from where I was, and to become an entrepreneur and a self-made millionaire. And by setting those goals, I got obsessed, I wrote the goals down on a piece of paper, and every single day I'd look at them, and I would get excited by it. And that's what drove me to take action, to really apply what I learned, and that's how everything turned around.
我学到的第三件事就是如何做大梦想，如何设定目标。我了解到，动机就是动机加行动，而我没有动力的原因是因为我没有目标，我不知道自己为什么要学习。过去，我父亲会问：“你这次考试能得什么成绩？”我回答：“我不知道，只要及格就行。”他会说：“就这些？”我说：“只要我觉得不太差就行。”然后他会看着我说：“亚当，五年后你会在哪里？”我回答：“我会在家。”他又问：“你的人生会在哪里？”我说：“我不知道，好吗？”所以，当你没有目标或令人信服的梦想时，你会迷失方向，被周围的一切分散注意力。

我从这个项目中学到，要有动力，我必须有一个动机，必须知道“为什么”。我不是为了我的父母学习，也不是为了我的老师学习，我是为了我自己学习。那么，我为什么要学习呢？于是我开始学习如何设定我想在人生中实现的目标。当时我老师教给我的一个最有力的道理是，如果你想要出众，就必须设定挑战性目标，让自己走出舒适区。

因此，我设定了一个目标：在一年内成为学校的第一名，进入维多利亚初级学院，这是新加坡顶尖的初级学院之一，进入新加坡国立大学，学习商科。每个人都认为这对我来说是不可能的，但我设定了这个目标，并开始执着于它。我把目标写在一张纸上，每天都看一遍，心中充满兴奋。这就是驱动我采取行动、真正应用所学的动力，也是让我一切都发生转变的原因。

So of course, as I started taking action, and for the first time in my life, I started paying attention in class, started making notes and asking questions. And again, did I understand everything that the teacher taught? I didn't, but when I didn't understand this time, I would just ask, and ask, and ask until I understood it. And the same thing when I read a chapter of my text book for the first time, I wouldn't get it because I was a slow learner, but you know what, I kept reading it until I got it. And I would mind map that same chapter one, two, three times until I mastered it, so it was pure hard work. And the results began to show. Within the first year, I was right among the top 20 position in my school. Now, my goal was to top the school, so I didn't achieve the goal. But I always tell myself that when you have a goal, you don't always achieve it the first time. But that's not failure, that's a learning experience. And even if you don't achieve the goal, it doesn't matter because by having a goal, it forces you to put in more effort, and you definitely improve. And so to me, I've learned that success is not a destination, it's a journey. As long as I take one step forward, that's success to me. So the next year, I worked even harder, and got among the top ten position in school. And for my Cambridge O levels of final year, I topped my school. And it was one of the most powerful experiences of my life. And I then went on to Victoria Junior college where also among the top students for for the Cambridge A levels. And I was going through all this I started a business at the side as well.
所以，当然，当我开始采取行动时，我人生中的第一次开始在课堂上认真听讲，开始做笔记和提问。虽然我并不是每次都能理解老师教的内容，但这次我会不断地问、问、再问，直到我理解为止。同样，当我第一次阅读课本的一个章节时，我可能并不明白，因为我是一个慢学习者，但我会继续阅读，直到我明白为止。我会对同一个章节画思维导图，一次、两次、三次，直到我掌握它，这完全是靠努力工作。结果开始显现。在第一年内，我的成绩已经跻身学校前20名。现在，我的目标是成为学校的第一名，所以我没有实现这个目标。但我总是告诉自己，当你有一个目标时，第一次未能实现并不算失败，而是一种学习经验。即使你没有达到目标也没关系，因为有了目标，它迫使你付出更多努力，你肯定会有所提高。

因此，我明白了，成功不是一个目的地，而是一个旅程。只要我向前迈出一步，这对我来说就是成功。于是第二年，我更加努力，进入了学校的前十名。在我的剑桥O Level最后一年，我成为了学校的第一名。这是我生命中最有力的经历之一。随后，我进入了维多利亚初级学院，在剑桥A Level中也位列前茅。在这一切进行的同时，我还开始了自己的副业。

Because I wanted to be that business man, so again my eventual goals with entrepreneur. So, I thought well why wait? Let's start something now. And I became a DJ for a mobile disco company where I spun records on weekends and school holidays. I saved up $2000 and at 15-years-old, I started up mobile disco company where I created events or birthday parties and corporate functions, so I was making money while I was studying. And then, continued to junior college. When I went to NUS, my event mobile business kept growing.
因为我想成为一名商人，所以我想，何必要等呢？我们现在就开始吧。我成为了一家流动迪斯科公司的DJ，周末和学校假期时我负责播放音乐。我攒了2000美元，在15岁时成立了自己的流动迪斯科公司，组织活动、生日派对和企业活动，这样我在学习的同时也能赚钱。之后，我继续上了初级学院。进入新加坡国立大学时，我的流动迪斯科业务不断壮大。

And I had a goal to top my entire business school in any way. So, I remember at that time, my father looked at me and said, Adam, how can you top NUS? It's the best and the brightest in Singapore. And I said but you know Dad, in secondary schools, I topped the school. So, I can do it in the NUS. And he said, in secondary school you were not smart. It's because all your friends were stupid.  So, my dad was one of the most negative people around, but he didn't mean to be negative, it was just his nature. And I'm the kind of person, the more you say I can't do something, the more I'm going to prove you wrong. So I said, dad, I'm going to show you, I'm going to beat these people, even thought they are from the top schools and I was not from the top school. And within the first year, I mean I didn't top my faculty, right? I didn't, again, I didn't achieve that goal, all right? But I was already among the top 1% of students at NUS. As a pioneer in the NUS Talent Development program, which is now known as a scholar's program. And to get in you have to be the top 1% of economic achievers in the US. And I was on the dean's list every single year and finished my four years honors degree in three years. And during that time, I was very passionate to share my story. So I went around to secondary schools, primary schools, to teach the kids about how I turned around from one of the bottom schools to topping the University of Singapore. And that's when I wrote my book, I'm Gifted So Are You, at 24 in my third year of university. And that's how it became a best-seller and I got pretty well known in Singapore.
我有一个目标，就是在商学院里名列前茅。所以，我记得那时我父亲看着我说：“亚当，你怎么可能在新加坡国立大学（NUS）出类拔萃？那里都是新加坡最优秀的人。”我说：“爸爸，你知道吗，在中学时我就是学校的第一名，所以我也可以在NUS做到。”他却说：“在中学时你并不聪明，都是因为你的朋友们太笨。”所以，我的父亲是个非常消极的人，但他并不是故意的，这就是他的本性。而我则是那种，越是说我做不到，我就越想证明你错了的人。

于是我对他说：“爸爸，我要让你看看，我会打败那些人，即使他们来自顶尖学校，而我并不是。”在第一年，我并没有在我的专业中名列第一，确实没有实现那个目标。但是我已经在新加坡国立大学的学生中名列前1%。作为NUS人才发展计划的先驱，那个计划现在称为学者计划，想要加入必须是经济学成就的前1%。而且我每年都在院长名单上，并且在三年内完成了四年的荣誉学位。

在这段时间里，我非常热衷于分享我的故事。因此，我去了中学、小学，教孩子们如何从底层逆袭到新加坡大学的顶尖学生。正是在那个时候，我在24岁时写了我的书《我是天才，你也是》，这是我在大学第三年写的。这本书成为了畅销书，我在新加坡变得相当有名。

Well, ok so now we've talked a lot about what happened in your school journey but let's go beyond platitudes and just go straight to what goes on in real everyday life for somebody in their 30s or 40s and what practical advice would you have for a person who's in mid-career. Who feels trapped in their job. They want to change maybe, and they're not sure about how to go about doing it. How could you take some of those ideas that you used to turn yourself around when you were young, can you use some of these same approaches when you're mid-career? Sure. So the principes apply whether you're in school or in a career. But wherever you are in life, you want a better life. You want to create a change. And again, the first principle is for the things to change, you have to change. So the first thing is to change your thoughts to look at problems as opportunities. To change your beliefs about what you are capable of that just because you are educated as an engineer, doesn't mean you must be an engineer for the rest of your life. You can be something else. In the old days it was one career for life. But the average person now in the 21st century global economy goes through three to four career changes in their life. Because we know that jobs that exist today, in ten years may no longer exist, they'll be outsourced or evolved. So, we've gotta have the mindset to create a shift. Beyond what we studied in school. That's number one. Number two is to change our capabilities. And we do that by constant and never-ending improvement. Taking online courses, like learning how to learn, taking life training program where we learn new skills beyond our vocational technical skills. Portable skills like communication skills that can be applied anywhere.
好的，我们已经谈了很多关于你在学校经历的事情，但让我们超越空话，直接谈谈在30多岁或40多岁的人在现实生活中面临的情况，以及你对那些在职业中感到受困、想要改变但不知如何下手的人的实用建议。你如何运用那些年轻时帮助你逆袭的理念，在职业中期时也能使用这些相同的方法呢？

当然，这些原则适用于无论你是在学校还是在职业生涯的任何阶段。不论你处于人生的哪个阶段，如果你想要更好的生活，想要创造变化，首先要明白一个原则：事情要改变，你必须改变。因此，第一步是改变你的思维，将问题视为机会。改变你对自己能力的信念：仅仅因为你受过工程师的教育，并不意味着你必须终生做工程师。你可以成为其他职业的人。过去，很多人只是一辈子从事一份职业。但在21世纪的全球经济中，普通人一生中通常会经历三到四次职业变化。因为我们知道，今天存在的工作在十年后可能就不再存在，它们可能会外包或演变。因此，我们必须具备创造转变的心态，超越我们在学校所学的知识。这是第一点。

第二点是改变我们的能力。这可以通过持续不断的自我提升来实现。参加在线课程，比如学习如何学习，参加生活技能培训，学习超出职业技术技能的新技能。掌握可转移的技能，例如沟通技巧，这些技能可以应用到任何地方。

Creativity skills, problem-solving skills, management skills and that thing, of course, would be to change by taking action, by taking a first step, by networking and that's how you will see the dots slowly being connected and find new ways to find new careers that you're more passionate about.
创造力技能、解决问题的技能、管理技能等等，当然，要实现这些变化，就必须采取行动，迈出第一步，进行网络交流。通过这些方式，你会慢慢看到各个点之间的联系，找到更让你充满热情的新职业道路。

So this leads right into our next question which is what do you do to help keep yourself motivated? What would you recommend to adults and older people who haven't experienced your kind of success to help them keep a positive attitude?
这就引出了下一个问题：你通常怎么做来保持自己的积极性？你会推荐给那些没有经历过你那种成功的成年人和年长者什么方法，以帮助他们保持积极的态度？

So let me just say, first of all, I don't wake everyday going yes. People think that successful people are motivated every single morning when they wake up, nothing could be further from truth. There are days I wake up, I don't feel I'm waking at all, all right. So, we all get lazy, and if you feel lazy at times, that's natural. So, motivation is like bathing. You can't bathe once and be clean for the rest of your life. You have to bathe every single day. So similarly, you have to motivate yourself every single day when you don't feel motivated. So the way I motivate myself is number one, when I wake up in the morning, I've got a ritual of reading my goals. What are my goals today? What are my goals five years from now? And as I read my goals, I get excited. And that frames my mind for the rest of the day. So, I know that what I'm doing now is moving towards something that is really important in the future. I also like to fantasize a lot. Yeah, right. So, besides reading my goals, I would then visualize myself achieving those goals. Visualize the impact it makes on my family. All right, the people I love, and the world. And how I can change the world in my small, little way. And when I visualize that trend, imagination, it excites me a lot. I also talk about my goals a lot. So whenever I meet people, I tell them, you know what? My new book's coming out. You know what? I'm going to change my career, for example. Because when I tell people that, it puts me on the line. And we got no choice but to find a way to make it happen.
所以，让我先说，我并不是每天早上醒来就充满动力。人们认为成功的人每天醒来都充满动力，这完全不是事实。有时候我早上醒来时甚至觉得自己没有醒来。所以，我们都会懒惰，如果你感到懒惰，那是很正常的。因此，动力就像洗澡一样。你不能只洗一次澡就保持干净一辈子。你必须每天都洗澡。同样地，当你没有动力时，你也必须每天激励自己。

我激励自己的方式有几个步骤。第一，当我早上醒来时，我会有一个阅读目标的仪式。我会问自己，今天的目标是什么？五年后的目标是什么？当我阅读我的目标时，我会感到兴奋。这为我接下来的一天设定了基调。我知道我现在所做的事情是在朝着一个对未来非常重要的目标前进。

我还喜欢进行大量的幻想。除了阅读目标之外，我还会想象自己实现这些目标的情景，想象这些目标对我的家人、我爱的人以及整个世界的影响，以及我如何以我微小的方式改变世界。当我进行这样的视觉化时，我会感到非常兴奋。

此外，我也会经常谈论我的目标。每当我遇到人时，我会告诉他们，我的新书快要出版了，我要改变我的职业等等。因为当我告诉别人这些时，它就把我推到了一个必须找到方法去实现这些目标的境地。

And when I go through problems, when things don't go the way I want, which is every day, all right, I've learned to reframe it. So, I've learned to reframe problems and the opportunities that matter what happens, always believe that things happen for a reason. There's something you can learn from there. So for example, if I lose a business deal, instead of saying, why did this happen to me? What am I so stupid? Why so unlucky? Ask what can I learn from this? And how can this lead to a breakthrough to get even bigger in the future? And that keeps me motivated.
当我遇到问题时，事情总是不会按照我想要的方式发展，我每天都会面临这种情况。我学会了重新框架这些问题。我学会了将问题重新定义为机会，无论发生什么事，我始终相信事情发生是有原因的，总是可以从中学习到一些东西。

例如，如果我失去了一个商业交易，我不会问“为什么会发生这样的事？我怎么会这么愚蠢？为什么这么不幸？”而是问“我能从中学到什么？这如何能成为一个突破，让我在未来更进一步？”这样的思维方式使我保持了动力。

So sometimes, as you mentioned, you're not motivated and in fact sometimes you have some bad characteristics. And you've had bad characteristic through your life, so can you tell me a little bit about how bad characteristics might actually sometimes be good characteristics. And how might some people in general use their bad characteristics in a way that helps them? Okay, so I believe there's no such thing as a bad characteristic or good characteristic. At least, no matter how bad a characteristic is in a certain context, when used appropriately, in a different context, can be an asset. So for example, again, one of my bad traits is I'm really stubborn. I'm a nonconformist, when everyone says this, I'll say, why can't we do something else? And it irritates the heck out of my teachers and my parents in the past. But I've learned to use that to my advantage. So again, when people told me in secondary school that you can't make it to junior college. You can't make it to university. That really motivates me to prove them wrong. And so that's how I've used it to my advantage. Another bad trait I would say, bad trait is that I'm slow learner. When I was young my friends could read a chapter of additional mathematics, calculus, and understand it the first time. Teacher could explain it the first time, they got it. I didn't get it. I had to read that same page three or four times before I got it. Teacher had to explain it a few times before I got it.
所以，正如你提到的，有时你并没有动力，事实上，有时你有一些不好的特质，而你在生活中也经历过这些不好的特质。那么你能告诉我一下，如何将不好的特质有时转变为好的特质？一般来说，人们如何利用他们的不良特质来帮助自己？

好的，我认为没有所谓的坏特质或好特质。至少，无论某种特质在特定的情况下有多么糟糕，如果在不同的背景下适当地使用，它都可以成为一种资产。例如，我的一个坏习惯就是我非常固执。当每个人都说“这样做不行”的时候，我会问，“为什么我们不能尝试其他方式？”这常常让我的老师和父母感到非常恼火。但我学会了将这一点转化为自己的优势。因此，当人们在中学时告诉我，你无法进入初级学院，无法上大学时，这真的激励我去证明他们是错的。这就是我如何利用我的固执。

另一个我认为是坏习惯的特质是我学习得很慢。当我年轻的时候，我的朋友可以在第一次阅读附加数学、微积分的章节时就理解它。老师第一次讲解时，他们就懂了。而我没有。我必须阅读同一页三到四次，才能理解。老师必须多解释几次，我才能明白。

And now I look back, that's a great asset, because now as a teacher myself, I'm now able to understand how slow learners like me process. And I'm able to take something which is complicated and make it really simple, so that anyone can learn. So again that has, I've used that to my advantage as well. So everything which is a liability can be looked at as an asset.
而现在回头看，这其实是一个很好的资产，因为现在作为一名老师，我能够理解像我这样的慢学习者是如何处理信息的。我能够将复杂的知识变得简单，让任何人都能学习。因此，我也将这一点转化为我的优势。所以，任何被视为负担的特质都可以被看作是资产。

We share so much in common, because sometimes I think my best trait as a teacher is that it's hard for me to understand things, and so I do find that once I understand them, I can only understand it if it's made simple. But once I do make it simple, it's much easier to explain to other people. If I was smarter, in some sense, I couldn't be as effective a teacher. Absolutely. So, what advice do you have for someone who feels that their job skills are becoming obsolete? Which is a very common thing- Sure. To happen today. What can people do to be more resilient in their careers? So the only way to create resilience to protect your career, is to ensure that you make yourself obsolete before someone makes you obsolete, all right. And the only way to do that, again, is through constant and never-ending improvement. And the first thing is an attitude, to ask yourself if what I'm doing now is the same thing I'm doing a year ago, something's wrong. It's gotta be better, it's gotta change.
所以，唯一创造韧性以保护你的职业的方法，就是在别人让你过时之前，先让自己变得过时。只有通过不断地、永不停息地改进，你才能做到这一点。首先，你需要有一个正确的心态，问自己：我现在所做的事情是否和一年前做的一样？如果是，那就有问题了。你必须在某些方面变得更好，必须有所改变。

And always ask yourself, how can I do something better than I did in the past. And I've always done that my life. So I love learning, and I've always been a lifelong learner. So I go online and I take courses all the time relating to my field or even outside of my field. And that allows me to have the breadth of knowledge and expertise to be able to do anything. So, if my business, if I knock on wood, were to be obsolete tomorrow, I can start a new business doing something else, adding value to the world with the portable skills I've created.
总是问问自己，如何能比过去做得更好。我一生中一直都是这样做的。我热爱学习，并且一直是一个终身学习者。因此，我会在线上不断参加与我所在领域相关或甚至是与我领域无关的课程。这让我拥有广泛的知识和专业技能，能够做任何事情。所以，如果我的生意，敲敲木头，明天变得过时，我可以开始一项新的业务，做其他事情，利用我所掌握的可转移技能为世界创造价值。

So, I know that luck plays a role in success in life. How can someone encourage luck? Okay. If you hear a lot of people speak, they say I got lucky, and I got lucky and I got lucky. And I believe that luck can be created. To me, that's an equation, luck equals to opportunity plus preparation plus action. So the first thing is you need opportunities. So do lucky people have more opportunities than unlucky people? Yes. And the reason is because see, opportunities never look like opportunities. Opportunities always come disguised as problems. And we all have problems. So, in other words, we all have opportunities disguised. But it takes a lucky person to see the opportunity disguised as a problem.
我知道运气在生活中的成功中起着重要作用。人们如何能鼓励运气呢？好吧。如果你听很多人说，他们会说我很幸运，我很幸运，我很幸运。我相信运气是可以创造的。对我来说，这是一种公式：运气=机会+准备+行动。因此，首先你需要机会。那么，幸运的人是否比不幸的人拥有更多机会呢？是的。原因在于，机会从来不看起来像机会。机会总是伪装成问题。我们都有问题。换句话说，我们都有伪装的机会。但只有幸运的人才能看到伪装成问题的机会。

And that can be learned. That's a shift of your paradigm. That's a shift of your mindset. So, for example, when I was young, again, my problem was that I was in a lousy class. I was a lousy student. And I always asked myself, why did this happen to me? Why can't I be a smart student? But at one stage I then said, hey, that problem is an opportunity. Because now I can write a book to share with people how a dumb person like me could top the university, and that's how it gave birth to the book I'm Gifted, So Are You. See, if I was smart all the way, I couldn't write that book. I'm Gifted So Are You. There's no credibility  give it back to you, right? So that was an opportunity. The second thing was, I was prepared. In other words, you got to have, you've got to be prepared to take advantage of the opportunities. So, if I was not prepared with the ability to write that book, if I was not prepared with the skills on how to promote and to sell that book, it would not have been a successful book. So always ensure you upgrade your skills so you have the internal resources, the creativity, the communication skills, the management skills to take advantage of the opportunities when you see them. And the third thing is the ability to get yourself to take that first step, to take action. because many people I know see the opportunity, they say I know what to do, I know how to do it, I never did it. Because they suffer from paralysis of analysis. What if I fail? People always ask, what if I fail? I look at them and ask them, what if you succeed?
这可以被学习。这是一个思维方式的转变，是范式的转变。例如，当我年轻的时候，我的问题是我在一个差的班级里，我是一个糟糕的学生。我总是问自己，为什么会发生这种事？我为什么不能成为一个聪明的学生？但在某个阶段，我说，嘿，那问题就是一个机会。因为现在我可以写一本书，分享一个像我这样笨的人如何在大学中获得第一名的故事，这就是我写下《我有天赋，你也有》这本书的起源。你看，如果我一直都很聪明，我就无法写那本书《我有天赋，你也有》。没有信誉可言，对吧？所以那是一个机会。第二点是，我已经做好了准备。换句话说，你必须准备好去利用机会。因此，如果我没有准备好写那本书的能力，如果我没有准备好推广和销售那本书的技能，那它就不会成为一本成功的书。因此，要始终确保你提升自己的技能，这样当你看到机会时，你就有内部资源、创造力、沟通技能和管理技能去利用它们。第三点是你必须能够迈出第一步，采取行动。因为我认识的很多人看到机会时，会说我知道该怎么做，我知道如何去做，但我从未去做。因为他们遭受分析麻痹的困扰。人们总是问，如果我失败了呢？我看着他们问，假如你成功呢？

Think about that, right? To me, when you take action, you always get results. You either get results you want or results you don't want, but you always get results. And if you take action and you get results you don't want, at least you learned something from it. You're better than someone else who talked and talked and thought and thought and thought but didn't do anything at all. So just take action, because you can't fail unless you don't learn something from it. Adam, I can't thank you enough for this great interview, and this is terrific. It's been a pleasure. Thank you so much.
考虑一下，对吧？对我来说，当你采取行动时，你总会得到结果。你要么得到你想要的结果，要么得到你不想要的结果，但你总会得到结果。如果你采取行动并得到不想要的结果，至少你从中学到了什么。你比那些只是谈论、思考却什么也不做的人要好得多。因此，只需采取行动，因为除非你从中学到东西，否则你就不会失败。亚当，非常感谢你这次精彩的访谈，真是太棒了。非常高兴能与你交流。谢谢你！



### Optional Bonus Video: Nelson Dellis Memory Tips #2

Hello again. Welcome. My name is Nelson. And in this video, we are gonna talk about how to memorize a grocery list, something that we have to do every day, almost every day; at least some type of list we have to memorize every day. And a grocery list is one of those items. So to memorize a list of things, we can use different techniques, but the best one, the one that memory champions use in competition to do these crazy things, is called the memory palace. But first, we need to decide what our list is. Now, you could just memorize the list by going through all these items in your head over and over again,but that's boring. That's the way you did it in preschool and kindergarten and first grade, sixth grade, high school. And it took you hours, and you hated it. The easy way is using this memory palace technique. Taking this list and putting it in a familiar place like your apartment or your house, your workplace, anything you know really well that you can navigate in your mind's eye. So what you do is you take yourself back to that place and you imagine those pieces of your grocery list along a path through that place. Now, it's up to you what to do with those images that you're going to put in the place. The more bizarre, out of the ordinary, crazy you make these pictures, the more you're gonna remember them. So try to make them as silly as possible. Don't understand what I mean quite yet? I'm going to show you. Let's dive into my mind and actually place these items on my grocery list around my apartment. Let's go. You ready? So as you can see, it's pretty easy to memorize any list as long as you just place those crazy images of whatever you're trying to memorize in a location. The idea is that when you go back to remember what you memorized - you're in the grocery store, you're trying to think of that list - all you have to do is mentally go back to that same place in your head where you stored them and walk back through, picking up the images that you laid on the floor, in the sink, in the bathtub, all along that same - very same path. Cool, right? The best thing about it - you can do that forwards, you can do that backwards. I could tell you what the fifth item was, six item was, all I have to do is jump to that location on my mind. And that is the memory palace. You can memorize thousands of digits, tons of packs of cards, all the presidents, every winner of the NFL Super Bowl, whatever you want, you can use the memory palace to memorize. I have no doubt in my mind that your memory will be awesome by the time you're done with it. I'll see you on the flip side as a memory champion.
你好，再次欢迎。我的名字是尼尔森。在这个视频中，我们将讨论如何记住一个购物清单，这几乎是我们每天都需要做的事情；至少每天我们都需要记住某种类型的清单。购物清单就是其中之一。为了记住一系列东西，我们可以使用不同的技巧，但最好的技巧，就是记忆冠军在比赛中使用的“记忆宫殿”技术。不过首先，我们需要决定我们的清单是什么。

现在，你可以通过在脑海中一遍又一遍地回顾这些项目来记住清单，但这很无聊。这是你在学前班、幼儿园、一年级、六年级和高中时所做的。这样做需要几个小时，你肯定不喜欢。简单的方法是使用这个记忆宫殿技术。将清单放在一个熟悉的地方，比如你的公寓、房子、工作场所，或者任何你非常熟悉的地方，这样你就可以在脑海中导航。

你所要做的是回到那个地方，并想象你的购物清单的各个项目沿着一条路径出现在那个地方。至于你要如何处理这些图像，完全取决于你。你越是让这些图像显得古怪、离谱、疯狂，你就越容易记住它们。所以尽量让它们变得尽可能搞笑。还不明白我的意思？我来给你展示一下。让我们一起深入我的思维，实际上在我的公寓里放置这些购物清单的项目。准备好了吗？

正如你所看到的，只要你将这些疯狂的图像放在一个地方，记住任何清单都是非常简单的。这个方法的核心是，当你回到购物时，想起你记住的东西时——比如你在商店里，试图回想那个清单——你只需在脑海中回到你存放它们的地方，沿着同一条路径走回去，捡起你放在地板上、洗碗池里、浴缸里的图像。这很酷，对吧？最棒的是——你可以正着走，也可以反着走。我可以告诉你第五个项目是什么，第六个项目是什么，我所要做的就是跳到我脑海中的那个位置。这就是记忆宫殿。你可以记住成千上万的数字、无数副扑克牌、所有的总统、每一届NFL超级碗的获胜者，随你所愿，你都可以使用记忆宫殿进行记忆。我毫不怀疑，等你完成时，你的记忆将会非常出色。再见，我们记忆冠军再见。

### 3-2 Passion and Work Part 1

We often face real challenges in our life between what we want to do, our passion and what kinds of opportunities there are out there in the working world. Let's take me, for example, as a young person. I had an absolute passion to study linguistics and to learn another language. Like many young people, I was a little headstrong. My father, on the other hand, kept saying, you can't easily get a job in linguistics. He nudged me towards learning something science-based. After all, he had had a great career as a veterinarian. I couldn't afford to go to the university on my own back then. College loans weren't easily available, but there was one way to learn the language and actually get paid for it and that was to join the army. That's why at 18, I began studying Russian at the Defense Language Institute. I was convinced that my father was wrong. And somehow, I'd find a great career for myself doing what I loved, but that's also how I found myself at age 26 in a career dead end.
我们常常面临生活中的真正挑战，即我们想做的事情、我们的激情与外面工作世界的机会之间的冲突。以我自己为例，作为年轻人，我对学习语言学和掌握另一种语言充满热情。像许多年轻人一样，我有点固执。我的父亲则不断说，语言学的工作不容易找。他鼓励我去学习一些与科学相关的专业。毕竟，他作为兽医有着很好的职业生涯。那时候，我无法自己负担上大学的费用，大学贷款也不容易获得，但有一种方法可以学习语言并且还可以获得报酬，那就是加入军队。这就是为什么在18岁时，我开始在国防语言学院学习俄语。我坚信我父亲是错的，想要找到一份做自己喜欢的工作的好职业，但这也是我在26岁时陷入职业困境的原因。

Although the military taught me a lot, when I decided to leave the military and return to the civilian world, I discovered I'd inadvertently put myself in a sort of trap. There wasn't a lot of call for people whose only professional skill was the ability to speak Russian and who knew little else. Much as I love the Russian language, I had put my focus on developing one single skill without thinking about how much that skill was really needed in the working world and without thinking about whether other skills might complement and enhance my ability to get the kinds of jobs I wanted to have. This is part of what I call the Passion Trap. We're often encouraged to follow our passions by well meaning people, friends and teachers, especially who don't themselves have to suffer the consequences of long term difficulties in getting a job. Friends after all, often want to make you happy right now. So, they'll often tell you what they think you want to hear. Teachers have a job teaching about their passion. This means that they benefit from encouraging you to take the classes and even aim towards their professions even if the chances of you actually getting a job related to that profession are minimal. On the other hand, parents, much like my father are often only focused on your finding a successful career. They can be less concerned about what you feel are your internal passions, especially if they, themselves have had a difficult life and they know how hard it can be to make a comfortable living. This push and pull between our internal passions, and the needs of the working world isn't something that just relates to young people. We often feel these forces throughout our lives. There are internal desires, the external needs of the world and many different influences from our family, our friends and our teachers and mentors. There is no one single answer to all this, but there are thoughtful ways to address this challenge as you think about your career and your approach to life long learning. Thinking visually about your talents can be helpful. That's what we'll cover in the next video.
虽然军队教会了我很多东西，但当我决定离开军队，回到平民生活时，我发现自己不知不觉中陷入了一种困境。仅仅掌握俄语这一项专业技能的人并不多，市场需求也不大。尽管我热爱俄语，但我将注意力集中在发展这项单一技能上，却没有考虑到这项技能在工作世界中的实际需求，也没有考虑到其他技能是否可以补充和增强我获得所希望工作的能力。这就是我所称的“激情陷阱”的一部分。我们常常受到好意的朋友和老师的鼓励，让我们追随自己的激情，尤其是那些不必承受长期找工作困难后果的人。毕竟，朋友们通常希望让你现在感到快乐，因此他们常常会告诉你他们认为你想听的话。老师们则是因为对自己所热爱的领域有了解，他们的工作就是教导这个领域。因此，他们鼓励你上他们的课，甚至朝着他们的职业方向努力，即使你实际上获得与该职业相关的工作的机会微乎其微。另一方面，像我父亲那样的父母，通常只关注你找到一份成功的职业。他们可能对你内心的激情不太关心，尤其是当他们自己经历过艰难的生活，并知道谋生有多么困难时。这种内心激情与外部工作需求之间的拉锯，不仅仅是年轻人面临的问题。在我们生活的整个过程中，我们常常会感受到这些力量。有内心的渴望、外部世界的需求以及来自家庭、朋友和老师、导师的各种不同影响。对此并没有一个单一的答案，但在你思考自己的职业和终身学习方法时，有一些深思熟虑的方式可以应对这一挑战。通过视觉化你的才能来思考是很有帮助的。接下来的视频中，我们将讨论这一点。



### 3-3 Passion and Work Part 2

Most people think about their career development as taking the form of a sort of a T. So you have your arms out, and the T going down. In other words, you have one heavy-duty skill, that's the downward part of the T, and you complement it by taking some superficial knowledge of other things. That's the initial approach I took to my career. I learned Russian, and also learned a smattering of other skills, like how to type, how to drive  a truck. The challenge of course, is that I found myself without too many opportunities. But there's another way to think about careers. That's the pi approach, which is promoted by Patrick Tay, an elected member of Singapore's Parliament. Notice that this career approach has sort of two legs, gives you more balance, right? And you have one main skill, say accounting, but you also want to supplement that with knowledge in another area, say counselling. The second area may be directly related or it may be quite different from the first. If time and money are tight, you should try to build your second skill out of what you're already familiar with. When I went to look at second skilling myself, I took a clue from what I'd witnessed in the military. Having at least some technical competence in your skills toolkit often means you have more opportunities. So that was a big push for me towards getting a second set of skills in engineering. Even though I didn't think I had any passion or talent for engineering. To my surprise, when I began getting better at my engineering studies, I began to realize I liked engineering and I found something more. My previous background as a linguist actually enhanced my studies of engineering and my ability as engineer. I'd learned about chunking and interleaving and deliberate practice. In other words, I'd learned how to learn. I thought more creatively about my engineering studies because of my passion for language. There are many examples of people becoming successful at their passion only because they stopped focusing directly and solely on that passion, and instead began incorporating real world considerations. For example, writer Scott Turow initially had trouble making it as an author. So he took a step sideways instead to attend law school. The real world expertise he acquired as a lawyer gave his fiction extraordinary power. His books have since sold more than 30 million copies around the world. As you know, my hero in science is the father of modern neuroscience, Santiago Ramon y Cajal. Cajal's father was a doctor who pushed his son hard towards becoming a doctor, but Cajal himself wanted to be an artist. Here it was, Spain in the 1860s, and the arguments between a parent and child were the same as they are today. Cajal's father pointed out that it was almost impossible to make a living as an artist but Cajal resisted strongly. Until, that is, Cajal finally realized that the real world is important. In fact, he was going nowhere fast. Finally, he began turning his attention towards working to become a doctor. It was very difficult for him. He flunked some major examinations, but he kept trying. However, he never forgot his passion for art. In fact, he brought that artistic passion into his study of medicine which ultimately played an important role in helping Cajal win the Nobel Prize. So remember, you can bring a second skill into your work because of your passion, or simply because it enhances or complements your first skill. You may have to spend some parts of your life focusing on one thing in order to get deep skilling in that area, but you don't have to give up on your passion. In fact, your passion can greatly enhance your creative ability in your other skill. In the end, it's never a good idea to just blindly follow your passion. In fact, look at the real world and work to both follow and broaden your passions. Your life will be greatly enriched.
大多数人认为职业发展可以用一个“T”形来描述。所以你有双臂伸展，而“T”向下延伸。换句话说，你拥有一项重大的技能，这就是“T”的竖线部分，然后你通过对其他事情的肤浅知识来补充它。这是我当初对职业的初步理解。我学习了俄语，同时也掌握了一些其他技能，比如打字和驾驶卡车。当然，挑战在于，我发现自己没有太多的机会。但还有另一种思考职业的方式，那就是“π”形的方式，这种方式是新加坡国会议员Patrick Tay所提倡的。注意，这种职业方法有两个支撑，更加平衡，对吧？你有一项主要技能，比如会计，但你还想补充另一领域的知识，比如咨询。第二个领域可能与第一个领域直接相关，也可能与第一个领域大相径庭。如果时间和金钱紧张，你应该尽量利用自己已有的知识来培养第二项技能。当我考虑第二项技能时，我从在军队时的经历中得到了启示。拥有一些技术能力的技能工具包通常意味着你会有更多机会。因此，这促使我朝着工程方面的第二技能发展。尽管我当时认为自己没有对工程的激情或天赋。令我惊讶的是，当我开始在工程学习中取得进步时，我意识到我喜欢工程，并发现了更多。我的语言学背景实际上增强了我对工程的学习和作为工程师的能力。我学会了分块、交错学习和刻意练习。换句话说，我学会了如何学习。因为我对语言的热爱，我在工程学习中更加创造性地思考。

许多成功人士的例子表明，他们之所以能够在自己的激情中取得成功，恰恰是因为他们不再仅仅专注于那种激情，而是开始融入现实世界的考量。例如，作家Scott Turow起初在成为作家方面遇到了困难。因此，他选择了横向发展，去上法学院。他作为律师所获得的现实世界经验赋予了他的小说非凡的力量。他的书籍至今在全球售出超过3000万本。如你所知，我心目中的科学英雄是现代神经科学之父，Santiago Ramon y Cajal。Cajal的父亲是一位医生，他强迫儿子走上医生的道路，但Cajal自己却想成为一名艺术家。在19世纪60年代的西班牙，父母与孩子之间的争论和今天一样。Cajal的父亲指出，作为艺术家几乎不可能谋生，但Cajal坚决反对。直到Cajal最终意识到，现实世界是重要的。实际上，他毫无进展。最后，他开始将注意力转向成为医生。对他来说，这非常困难。他在一些重要考试中不及格，但他不断努力。然而，他从未忘记对艺术的热爱。事实上，他将这种艺术热情带入了医学研究中，这最终在帮助Cajal赢得诺贝尔奖方面发挥了重要作用。

所以请记住，你可以将第二项技能融入工作中，无论是因为你的激情，还是因为它增强或补充了你的第一项技能。你可能需要在生活的某些阶段专注于一件事，以便在该领域深耕，但你不必放弃自己的激情。事实上，你的激情可以极大地增强你在其他技能方面的创造力。最终，盲目追随你的激情从来都不是一个好主意。实际上，审视现实世界，努力同时追求和拓宽你的激情，这样你的生活将会大大丰富。



### 3-4 Passion and Work Part 3

In the last video we talked about careers and skills as being either t-shaped, with only one deep skill, or pi-shaped with two areas of emphasis. But of course there are other ways to think about careers and skills and don't forget that hobbies can also play a role in your life of learning. Not do they make you happy, they help keep your brain fresh and agile. Sometimes they can even end up enhancing your career. For example, one of my hobbies is to watch a bit of television in the evenings with my husband, Phil. And this help me develop insights over the years about how the video medium looks and works, which in turn has helped me to build better MOOCs.
在上一个视频中，我们讨论了职业和技能可以被视为“T”型，只有一项深厚的技能，或者“π”型，具有两个重点领域。当然，还有其他方式可以看待职业和技能，也不要忘记爱好在你的学习生活中也能发挥作用。爱好不仅能让你快乐，还能帮助你的大脑保持活力和灵活。有时，它们甚至可能增强你的职业发展。

例如，我的一个爱好是在晚上和我的丈夫Phil一起看一些电视节目。多年来，这帮助我对视频媒介的外观和运作方式发展了一些见解，这反过来又帮助我建立了更好的MOOC课程。

But look at how other people think about building their skill sets. Scott Adams, who's the creator of the famous Dilbert cartoon, points out that he's got mediocre skills in a lot of areas. He's a second grade artist, with reasonable writing, business, marketing, and social media skills. Put all those middling skills together, however, and it becomes clearer why Adams has been so successful as a cartoonist. His overall talent stack is terrific, even if he's not particularly good at any one area.
但是看看其他人是如何看待构建他们的技能组合的。著名的《迪尔伯特》漫画创作者斯科特·亚当斯指出，他在很多领域的技能都很普通。他的绘画水平一般，但在写作、商业、市场营销和社交媒体方面有一定的能力。然而，将这些平庸的技能结合在一起，就更能清楚地看出为什么亚当斯作为漫画家如此成功。他的整体技能组合非常出色，即使他在任何一个领域都不是特别优秀。

Many individuals focus on acquiring a specific skill, say, a certain programming language. But they forget that other skills, such as being able to speak humorously and effectively, can add formidable value to their talents stack. US sales entrepreneur Rodney Grim for example, keeps his focus on his broad profession in selling electronics. As he points out. I'm a jack of all trades. While this limits me from truly excelling at one thing in particular. It also serves as a strong defense in a technological world where the rate of change is only accelerated. I've been an electronics technician, a programmer, a salesman. I also own my own business. And I shift my roles drawing on my background as opportunity and change dictate.
许多人专注于掌握某项特定技能，比如某种编程语言。但他们忘记了其他技能，比如幽默而有效的沟通能力，可以为他们的技能组合增加强大的价值。例如，美国销售企业家罗德尼·格里姆专注于自己在电子产品销售方面的广泛职业。正如他所指出的：“我是一个万事通。虽然这限制了我在某一特定领域真正出类拔萃，但在技术变化日益加速的世界中，这也成为了我的强大防御。我曾是一名电子技术员、一名程序员、一名销售员。我还拥有自己的企业，并根据机遇和变化调整我的角色。”

Brian Brookshire who's worked as an online marketing specialist, looks at second-skilling from a related perspective.
布赖恩·布鲁克希尔（Brian Brookshire）曾担任在线营销专家，他从相关的角度看待第二技能的提升。

To tell the truth, often there really isn't that much difference between someone who's been on the job for six months and someone who's been working that same job for six years. So second skilling doesn't need to be as difficult as you might think.
说实话，通常在同一份工作工作六个月的人和工作六年的人之间并没有太大的差别。因此，第二技能的提升并不像你想象的那么困难。

Skill development careers are typically logarithmic and not linear. Which means that, while developing deep expertise may take a long time, often, you can rapidly accelerate to the point of diminishing returns in a fairly short period of time. And this is often good enough to get a toehold in a new area. Personally, I find that I really enjoy requiring lots of new skills because of that thrill you get with the initial rush of progress.
技能发展的职业通常是对数型的，而不是线性的。这意味着，虽然培养深厚的专业知识可能需要很长时间，但通常，你可以在相对较短的时间内迅速加速到收益递减的点。而这往往足以让你在一个新领域立足。就我个人而言，我发现自己非常享受学习大量新技能，因为那种初步进展带来的兴奋感让我感到很快乐。

Sometimes you might find yourself blocked when you're aiming for a certain career. For example, Princess Allotey, couldn't afford to go full time to the university to study the mathematics she loved. So I intend to give back to my community. I volunteered as a math teaching assistant, and I taught kids math in Ghana. I certainly proved language can improve things for kids in Ghana. And I ended up going around Ghana making presentations. Surprisingly, I developed this skill what I always wanted to do enough, and that was public speaking. Intishar Rashad from Bangladesh has also made the most of a startling change of fortune. When I graduated from high school, I decided to go into the military to become an air force engineer. However, due to an accident, I suffered a severe spine injury and it seemed to ruin my potential career choice. Instead of losing hope, I changed my mindset and now I'm a medical student focusing on a career in medicine. So if you're blocked, either temporarily or permanently in what you want to learn or do, that's often a great opportunity to second skill yourself, or do something else that's equally exciting or fulfilling. Once you started learning the new skill, you'll often be surprised to see the powerful enhancement it makes with relation to your preexisting skills. And remember, non-academic topics can be invaluable assets to your career. For example, Singapore entrepreneur, Adam Koo, found that his skills in magic And in DJing, completely unrelated to his degree in business, have taught him a lot about how to effectively engage with audiences. The result, he now runs one of Southeast Asia's largest private educational institutions training to tens of thousands each year. In the end, it's always important to keep your mind open and to keep learning. This is the best way to ensure your skills don't become obsolete. Read, take MOOCS, and take courses and seminars to keep yourself prepared, no matter what twists or turns your career may take. Do you have a skill or hobby that's been overlooked but that could be valuable? Are there new technical areas you could start now to gradually learn about that you've previously dismissed as being something you wouldn't be able to do? Head on over to the discussion forum and let us know about some of your hidden talent, potential and desires. And get ideas from the hidden talent and potential of others.
有时，当你朝着某个职业目标努力时，可能会发现自己遇到了障碍。例如，Princess Allotey因为负担不起全日制上大学学习自己热爱的数学而感到困扰。于是，她决定回馈社区，担任数学助教，教孩子们数学。我确实证明了语言可以改善加纳孩子们的学习。我还在加纳各地进行演讲。出乎意料的是，我发展了我一直想做的技能，那就是公共演讲。来自孟加拉国的Intishar Rashad也在突如其来的命运变化中充分发挥了自己的潜力。高中毕业时，我决定参军，成为一名空军工程师。然而，由于一次事故，我遭受了严重的脊椎损伤，这似乎毁了我的职业选择。面对这样的困境，我没有失去希望，而是改变了心态，现在我是一名医学生，专注于医学事业。

因此，如果你在想学习或做的事情上暂时或永久地受到阻碍，这往往是一个很好的机会来提升第二技能，或去做其他同样令人兴奋或有成就感的事情。一旦你开始学习新技能，通常会惊讶地发现它对你现有技能的强大增强效果。并且请记住，非学术主题也可以成为你职业生涯中宝贵的资产。例如，新加坡企业家Adam Koo发现，他在魔术和DJ方面的技能，与他商业学位完全无关，却教会了他如何有效地与观众互动。结果，他现在运营着东南亚最大的私立教育机构之一，每年培训数万名学生。

最后，始终保持开放的心态和不断学习是非常重要的。这是确保你的技能不会过时的最佳方式。阅读、参加MOOC、参加课程和研讨会，以便随时做好准备，无论你的职业生涯经历怎样的曲折。你是否有被忽视的技能或爱好，但它可能会很有价值？是否有你以前认为自己做不到的新技术领域可以现在开始逐步学习？前往讨论论坛，告诉我们你的一些隐藏才能、潜力和愿望，并从他人的隐藏才能和潜力中获取灵感。



### 3-5 Mindshifting – What to Do in the Face of Opposition

One tough challenge is deciding when young people should be directed towards a specific career, because this decision can have reverberations that can last throughout people's lives. In some parts of the world, students are sorted into career paths early on. At age 16, for example, they may be sent to either vocational training for the skilled trades or towards more academically oriented training. In other parts of the world, this choice is sometimes delayed. There are advantages and disadvantages to each of these approaches. People choose career paths for all sorts of reasons. In some countries, the parents often make the choice, regardless of what their kids want to do. In other countries, the students themselves often make the choice, despite the fact that they may have almost no real world experience with the job choice they're making. Or sometimes, people simply come from a background where they've had no previous access to quality education or even to any proper education at all, which means that their career choices are limited from the outset.
一个艰难的挑战是决定年轻人何时应该被引导向特定的职业，因为这个决定可能会对人们的生活产生长远的影响。在世界某些地方，学生很早就被分配到职业道路上。例如，在16岁时，他们可能被送往职业培训以学习技术工种，或者接受更学术导向的培训。在世界其他地方，这一选择有时会被推迟。这两种方法各有优缺点。

人们选择职业道路的原因多种多样。在一些国家，父母常常做出选择，而不管孩子们想做什么。在其他国家，学生们则通常自己做出选择，尽管他们对所做职业选择几乎没有任何实际的工作经验。有时，人们来自的背景也可能意味着他们之前没有接受过优质教育，甚至没有接受过任何适当的教育，这意味着他们的职业选择一开始就受到限制。

Or people can be on a very wisely chosen career path but then once they're exposed to new opportunities and insights, they may want to change. Career change, and change of all kinds, is easier to do in some countries and cultures than others. And, of course, it can be easier to jump from some disciplines than others, age is also a factor. But as you probably gathered, my own sense is that well thought out career change, and change of any kind, whether a small shift to acquire a different set of skills that enhance your abilities to do your job within your company, or a major shift to a new career. Forms of vitally important, creative fuel for all societies. One of the biggest hurdles to changing career paths or a change of any sort can be well meaning friends, parents, and colleagues. It's not like this sort of push back from others is necessarily a bad thing. It makes you consider your choice very carefully. One important rule of thumb, is to avoid going into debt while learning new skills at the field you're hoping to move into is poorly paid. There's something very wrong in spending a large amount to acquire a new knowledge or new skills, only to be poorly paid when you ultimately get out on the job. If you are considering career change or even simple second skilling, here are a few tips for dealing with the push back from others, who might want you to stay the way you are. With the dabble approach, you simply start gradually learning in the new area, either online, through reading or by taking local classes. This is a slow approach. But it can also help ensure that you, yourself, can gradually grow with the change, which will make the transition less jarring for all involved. The double life approach is much more intense than dabbling. With this approach, you basically compartmentalize your life and avoid talking to people about what you're trying to do. This can be a more stressful way to tackle your change, but it can have an advantage. It can prevent others from trying to talk you out of your goals because you'll appear to be continuing just as usual. For example, you may continue working as a musician while you're taking side courses to prepare you for a career in health care. And then there's being a contrarian. Take pride in being a contrarian. The more others say you will fail, the more it can help bolster your internal resolve. Keep in mind, however, that it's important to choose reachable and doable interim goals and check points to assess your progress. For example, if you tried as hard as you can, but repeatedly get very low scores on the test to get into medical school, it maybe time to reassess your dream of going to medical school. And don't forget that who you are is not just you.
或者，人们可能处于一个非常明智选择的职业道路上，但一旦接触到新的机会和见解，他们可能会想要改变。职业变更，以及各种变化，在一些国家和文化中比其他地方更容易。当然，从某些学科跳槽比其他学科更容易，年龄也是一个因素。但是，正如你可能已经意识到的，我个人认为，经过深思熟虑的职业变更，以及任何形式的变化，无论是为了获得一组不同的技能以增强你在公司内部工作的能力的小转变，还是向新职业的大幅转变，都是所有社会中至关重要的创造性燃料。

改变职业道路或任何形式变化的最大障碍之一可能是出于好意的朋友、父母和同事。来自他人的这种阻力并不一定是坏事。它使你非常仔细地考虑自己的选择。一个重要的经验法则是，避免在学习新技能时产生债务，尤其是当你希望进入的领域薪水较低时。在花费大量资金获取新知识或新技能后，最终工作时却得不到良好的报酬，这显然是有问题的。

如果你正在考虑职业变更甚至简单的第二技能提升，以下是一些应对他人推阻的建议，他们可能希望你保持现状。通过“试探法”，你可以逐渐在新领域学习，无论是在线学习、阅读还是参加当地课程。这是一种缓慢的方法，但它也可以帮助确保你自己能够逐渐适应变化，这将使所有相关人员的过渡变得不那么突兀。

而“双重生活法”则比试探法更为激烈。通过这种方法，你基本上把生活分开，并避免与他人谈论你正在尝试做的事情。这可能是一种更具压力的方式来应对变化，但它也有一个优势。它可以防止他人试图劝说你放弃目标，因为你会显得一切照常进行。例如，你可能继续作为音乐工作，同时参加副课程为进入医疗行业做好准备。

最后，还有“逆反者”策略。为成为逆反者感到自豪。别人越是说你会失败，越能增强你的内在决心。然而，请记住，选择可实现的、可行的中期目标和检查点以评估你的进展是很重要的。例如，如果你已经尽全力，但在医学院入学考试中反复获得很低的分数，那么是时候重新评估你进入医学院的梦想了。别忘了，你的身份不仅仅是你自己。

Who you are also depends on your environment. This means, that by changing your environment, you can speed up the process of mind shifting. I shifted from physics to biology by immersing myself in the best neuroscience environment I could find. I picked up a lot of facts, but much more important, was what I learned by osmosis without conscious awareness of what it was I was learning. I learned how to think like a biologists, by being around biologists and interacting with them. I did make a conscious effort not to fall back on what I had been, a physicist and mindset and skills of a physics. I took a vow of physics poverty to remain open to what was new around me rather than revert back to the old thought patterns. This approach also works for learning a new language, you get to observe the culture along with the language.
你是谁也取决于你的环境。这意味着，通过改变环境，你可以加速思维转变的过程。我通过沉浸在我能找到的最佳神经科学环境中，从物理学转向生物学。我掌握了很多事实，但更重要的是，我在无意识的情况下通过渗透学习到了很多东西。我通过与生物学家在一起并与他们互动，学会了像生物学家一样思考。我确实有意识地努力不让自己回到物理学家的思维方式和技能上。我发誓要放弃物理学的贫困，以保持对周围新事物的开放，而不是回归旧的思维模式。这种方法对学习一门新语言也适用，你可以在学习语言的同时观察文化。

In your attempts at career change, you don't want to minimize important considerations. Like whether you've got at least the basics of what it might take to succeed. Be willing to solicit and listen to valid criticism about how you can change and improve. You don't want to be like the cluelessly bad karaoke singer, warbling haplessly into the night because his friends always told him he was great. If you are a friend, parent, or mentor, of a potential mind shifter, try your best to remain open to other people's ability to change. And if you're the one who's making the change yourself, count yourself lucky if those around you are supportive, and use the opportunity to enjoy your new learning path.
在你尝试职业转变时，不要忽视一些重要的考虑因素，比如你是否具备成功所需的基本条件。愿意征求并倾听关于你如何改变和改进的有效批评是很重要的。你不想成为那个 clueless 的糟糕卡拉OK歌手，傻傻地在夜晚唱着，因为他的朋友们总是告诉他他唱得很好。如果你是一个潜在的思维转变者的朋友、父母或导师，尽量对其他人改变的能力保持开放态度。如果你是自己进行改变的人，如果身边的人支持你，那你就要感到幸运，并利用这个机会享受你新的学习之路。


### 3-6 General Competence versus Selective Ignorance

If you have long term goals in a difficult to master area, one of the best things you can do is to immerse yourself in what you're learning. For example, if you're planning to become successful in the restaurant business, one of the best things you can do is to get experience in every aspect of restauranting that you possibly can, from busing tables, to serving, to managing accounts. Without this kind of experience, it can be a lot easier to make mistakes that allow your future business to fail. This may seem obvious, but sometimes the cockiness that helps fuel and, results from our success in one area can go to our heads. Even eminent scientists, for example, have been known to fail disastrously when they tried to jump into a new area without getting themselves properly prepared. My co-instructor, Terry Sejnowski, for example, took these ideas into account when he switched from the study of physics to the study of neuroscience. I was advised to get neurons under my fingernails. I worked hard over years to master the biology I needed to truly understand the new discipline I was moving into. At the same time, I practiced selective ignorance. I knew that my expertise with computers, a rare asset in the late 1970s, could mean that I'd be dragged into computer related work that would keep me away from the biology I needed to master. So I vowed not to touch a computer during those years, giving me time to focus on the biology that I needed to master. Selective ignorance, then, is another important career tip. You want to master all the details that you can that will support you in what you're trying to learn or do. But at the same time, you don't want to simply start being used by other people as a tool for their own work. Marketing specialist, Bryan Brookshire, has some additional insight along these lines. I told a former boss that I wanted to learn how to do everything at the company and her reply was, don't do that. You've got to cultivate selective ignorance because if you know how to do everything, then you become everybody's go to person and that can interfere with getting your own work done, and that turned out to be pretty good advice. Cultivating selective ignorance has often prevented me from getting drafted into projects that I had no interest in participating in, or time for.
如果你在一个难以掌握的领域有长期目标，最好的做法之一就是全身心投入到你所学习的内容中。例如，如果你计划在餐饮业取得成功，最好的方法之一就是尽可能多地积累餐饮各个方面的经验，从清理餐桌、服务，到管理账目。如果没有这种经验，你可能更容易犯错误，导致未来的生意失败。这听起来很明显，但有时，我们在某个领域的成功所带来的自负会让我们变得傲慢。例如，著名科学家在跳入新领域而没有做好充分准备时，往往会遭遇灾难性失败。我的共同讲师特里·塞诺斯基在从物理学转向神经科学的过程中，就考虑到了这些因素。我被建议要“让神经元在我的指甲下留下印记”。我努力花了多年时间掌握我需要的生物学知识，以真正理解我所转入的新学科。与此同时，我也练习选择性无知。我知道，自己在1970年代末期对计算机的专长可能会让我被拉入与计算机相关的工作，这会妨碍我专注于需要掌握的生物学。因此，我发誓在那几年不碰计算机，给自己留出时间专注于需要掌握的生物学。因此，选择性无知是另一个重要的职业建议。你要掌握所有能支持你学习或工作的细节，但同时，不要让自己成为他人工作中的工具。市场营销专家布莱恩·布鲁克希尔对此有一些额外的见解。他告诉我，一位前老板对他说他想学会公司里的所有工作，而她的回应是：“不要这样做。你得培养选择性无知，因为如果你知道如何做所有事情，你就会成为每个人的首选，这会干扰你自己的工作。”这条建议证明是非常好的。培养选择性无知常常让我避免参与那些我没有兴趣或没有时间参与的项目。

So there you have it, general competence, along with selective ignorance are two important keys for career success.
所以，综合能力和选择性无知是职业成功的两个重要关键。



### 3-7 The Value of Feeling Like an Imposter

The imposter syndrome is that feeling that you're not as good or as talented as the other people around you. It's actually a very common feeling, especially if you're venturing into a new or different area. Often, feeling like an imposter makes you afraid that you won't be able to succeed at whatever tasks lay before you. After all, you think, if everyone around you is somehow more talented or knowledgeable, what chance do you have to succeed? These feelings can make the tasks ahead of you seem even more formidable and difficult. Your mind tells you, you only got to where you are because of good luck, and you suspect that good luck might not be enough to continue to propel yourself forward to success. Psychologists often say that feeling like an imposter is a bad thing, and you should just stop feeling like that. But here's an important point. Doubting yourself isn't always bad. It can keep you more open and flexible to seeing and doing what you need to do to succeed. And in fact, people who are open to self doubt tend to be more successful in the long run. Why is this? As it turns out, people can tend to fail, not so much from under confidence, but from overconfidence. History is filled with the stories of business executives, generals, and politicians who only listen to others when they reinforce their own convictions. These leaders then steer with blithe abandon towards disaster. Doubt, of course, can be overdone, but it can also be undervalued. In fact, if you're full of doubt, that means you have a mindset that leaves you more open to what's going on around you. It can spur you on to try harder, and as we know in this course, it's persistence and flexibility that can be what matters most in the long run, not genius. It's natural that most of us except, perhaps, the most brash and narcissistic can fall occasional pray to feeling like an imposter. Accepting that these feelings are normal and re-framing them to our advantage forms a healthy way to move forward.
冒名顶替综合症是指你感到自己不如周围其他人优秀或有才华的感觉。这实际上是一种很常见的感受，尤其是在你进入一个新的或不同的领域时。通常，感到自己像个冒名顶替者会让你担心自己无法成功完成眼前的任务。毕竟，你会想，如果你周围的每个人似乎都更有才华或知识，那么你成功的机会有多大呢？这些感觉会让你面前的任务显得更加艰巨和困难。你的内心告诉你，你之所以能走到今天，是因为运气好，而你怀疑这样的好运是否足以让你继续前进，取得成功。

心理学家通常认为，感到自己像个冒名顶替者是一件坏事，你应该停止这种感觉。但这里有一个重要的观点：怀疑自己并不总是坏事。它可以让你更加开放和灵活，去观察和做你需要做的事情，以取得成功。事实上，开放自我怀疑的人在长期来看往往更成功。这是为什么呢？事实证明，人们失败往往不是因为缺乏自信，而是因为过于自信。历史上充满了商业高管、将军和政治家的故事，他们只听取那些强化自己信念的人的意见。这些领导者就这样无所畏惧地驶向灾难。

当然，怀疑有时可能过度，但它也可能被低估。事实上，如果你充满疑虑，这意味着你有一种更开放的心态，可以更好地观察周围发生的事情。这可以激励你更加努力地尝试，正如我们在这门课程中所了解到的，持久性和灵活性在长期中往往比天才更重要。大多数人，除了那些极为自负和自恋的人，偶尔都会感到像个冒名顶替者。接受这些感觉是正常的，并将它们重新框架为有利的方式，形成了一种健康的前进方式。



### 3-8 Avoiding Career Ruts and Surviving Career Catastrophes

Wherever you are in your career path, whether young, mid-career, or even in retirement, it can help to keep your eye on the big picture of societal trends in relation to your special skills. When I was young I followed my passion into a box of having a single special skill, the ability to speak a second language. I didn't think or plan to complement that ability with other skills that could give me more flexibility in the job marketplace. We know that language and culture are important. But in today's society, technological, scientific, and mathematical literacy and expertise are of increasing importance, as well. So if you have a soft-skill area of interest, it can be a good idea to balance that with some technical or analytical skills. But likewise, if you already have sharp analytical skills, it can be a good idea to enhance your talent stack by working on your soft skills such as speaking ability or writing. On a side note, I wish I had a dollar for every older student I've had in my engineering classes, who like me, followed their passion, and spent a lot of money to get a first degree in a subject that was difficult to get a good job at. I'm not saying engineering is the only field to study, although I will admit to a little bias for engineering as good general training in today's society. But be aware how easy it can be during the career selection process to fall into a  sheeple mentality. Where you and your friends don't find out until it's too late that you've put yourself into decades of debt studying a favorite subject that's better off as a hobby than as a career. What if you get fired or laid off from a job? A valuable point to keep in mind here is what I'll call, the golden rule of career catastrophes. And that is, it is never as bad as you think it is at the time and there is always a silver lining.  Almost always as a result of being either fired or laid off, you ultimately find yourself happier in the long run. Even Pete Best, who was kicked out of the great band The Beatles, right before they went on to world fame, was able to find a wonderful silver lining in his career catastrophe. After his ousting from the band, he would go on to meet his wife, the great love of his life. Keep in mind that it's not usually a good idea to become too settled for too many years doing the same job. You can slip into a career rut that can be difficult to get out of. Even if you're doing a variety of activities for your work, your mind can still be following into the route or rut. Which means it can gently be moving towards stagnation. In any case, you may think you have the perfect career, but things can change in a heartbeat. One simple swap in management can mean an upheaval. Even great scientists like Francis Crick, the Nobel Prize winning co-discoverer of DNA made a point of changing his area of focus to keep himself fresh as he grew older. At age 60 he switched from the study of molecular biology to the study of consciousness. This is something like spending your life as a construction worker and then deciding you're going to switch to become an expert in creating great embroidery. The result, Crick's lively intellect retained its sharp ability to focus until his dying day.
无论你在职业道路上处于哪个阶段，无论是年轻人、中年人，还是退休人士，关注社会趋势与自己特长技能之间的关系都是有益的。当我年轻时，我追随自己的热情，专注于一种特殊技能——说一门外语。我没有考虑或计划用其他技能来补充这一能力，从而在就业市场上获得更多的灵活性。我们知道语言和文化非常重要，但在当今社会，技术、科学和数学素养及专业知识也越来越重要。因此，如果你对软技能领域感兴趣，结合一些技术或分析技能可能是个好主意。同样，如果你已经具备了出色的分析技能，那么通过提升你的软技能，例如口语或写作能力，来增强你的才能组合也是明智的。

顺便提一下，我真希望我能为每一位我在工程课程中遇到的老年学生赚到一美元。他们像我一样追随自己的热情，花了大量的钱获得一个难以找到好工作的学位。我并不是说工程是唯一值得学习的领域，尽管我承认对工程有一点偏见，因为它在当今社会是良好的通用培训。但要意识到，在职业选择过程中，陷入“羊群心理”的容易程度。你和你的朋友可能直到为时已晚才发现自己已经在一个更适合作为爱好的学科上投入了几十年的债务。

如果你被解雇或裁员怎么办？在这里要记住一个宝贵的观点，我称之为“职业灾难的黄金法则”。那就是：事情从来没有你当时想得那么糟糕，总会有一个积极的一面。几乎总是因为被解雇或裁员，你最终会发现自己在长期内更快乐。甚至像皮特·贝斯特这样的人，被伟大的乐队披头士在他们走向世界名声之前踢出，也能在他的职业灾难中找到美好的转机。在被乐队开除后，他遇到了自己的妻子，成为他一生的挚爱。

请记住，长时间固定在同一工作上通常不是个好主意。你可能会陷入职业低谷，难以摆脱。即使你在工作中做着各种各样的活动，你的思维也可能依然跟随进入低谷。这意味着它可能会慢慢趋向停滞。无论如何，你可能认为自己拥有完美的职业，但情况可能会瞬息万变。管理层的一次简单变动可能意味着动荡。即使是像弗朗西斯·克里克这样伟大的科学家——诺贝尔奖获得者、DNA的共同发现者，他也强调了在年龄增长时改变研究重点以保持新鲜感的重要性。在60岁时，他从分子生物学的研究转向意识的研究。这就像花一生时间做建筑工人，然后决定转行成为刺绣专家一样。结果，克里克的聪明才智在他去世的那天仍保持着敏锐的专注力。



### 3-9 Bad Traits as Best Traits


You maybe surprised to learn that some of your worst traits can sometimes be some of your best traits. This means that when you get down on yourself for some of your bad characteristics, it's a good idea to start reframing your thinking. In this video, we'll help you get started. Let's take for our first example having a poor working memory. As we've already mentioned, having a poor working memory often indicates that you're more creative. When something falls out of the slots of your working memory, something else tends to pop in. Do you have to work harder to keep up with people who have that steel trap sort of memory? Sure, but you wouldn't want to give up the joyful advantages that your creativity gives you. And of course, people with less capable working memories are more likely to see short cuts and to have conceptual breakthroughs. Poor working memory incidentally is often correlated with Attention Deficit Disorder. So if this condition is making your learning tougher for you, it's important to realize it also gives you advantages. You may argue that a strong working memory not only helps with problem solving, it also helps with getting good grades but research has shown that there's a counter correlation between school grades and creativity. In other words, sometimes the better your grades, the worse your creativity. For some reason my fellow professors who were usually the best of the best students seem to get annoyed with me when I bring up that little factoid. Maybe that's also the origin of the old saying, the A students end up working for the C students. But there's also a correlation between disagreeableness and creativity. It may simply be that disagreeable people are more willing to be brats, to throw aside that compliant deferential behavior of their more agreeable peers. Are you a contrarian? That too can serve as an advantage when everyone's telling you you just can't succeed, you're contrarian nature combined with a little bit of common sense can be just the ticket to prove them wrong. What about being a worrier? Well, as a worrier myself, I'll be the first to admit that worrying has got some unhealthy aspects to it. But anxiety can allow you to anticipate possibilities by mentally reviewing different scenarios even if they're negative. And that's not all bad. Doing a bit of worrying and then reframing your thoughts to calm your brain in the ways we've discussed earlier is a great way to go. And how about being a naive dreamer? If you're naive, it's a nice idea to partner and work with more practical people. But a little bit of naive dreaming helps keep the world moving forward on a positive note. No one would want to give that up.
你可能会惊讶地发现，自己的一些最差特质有时实际上可以变成最好的特质。这意味着，当你因为某些坏性格而对自己感到沮丧时，重新思考是个好主意。在这个视频中，我们将帮助你入门。首先以工作记忆差为例。正如我们之前提到的，工作记忆较差往往表明你更具创造力。当某些东西从你的工作记忆中消失时，其他东西往往会进入。你确实需要更加努力地跟上那些记忆力像钢铁一样坚固的人吗？当然，但你绝对不想放弃你创造力所带来的愉悦优势。当然，工作记忆较差的人更有可能看到捷径并获得概念上的突破。顺便提一下，工作记忆差通常与注意力缺陷障碍相关联。因此，如果这种情况使你的学习变得更加困难，重要的是要意识到它也给你带来了优势。

你可能会争辩说，强大的工作记忆不仅有助于解决问题，还有助于获得好成绩，但研究表明，学校成绩与创造力之间存在负相关关系。换句话说，有时你的成绩越好，创造力反而越差。出于某种原因，我的教授同事们通常是最优秀的学生，但当我提到这个小事实时，他们似乎会感到恼火。也许这也是那句老话的来源：A学生最终为C学生工作。但是，不可合作性与创造力之间也存在相关性。也许正是因为不合群的人更愿意表现得像个小霸王，抛弃他们更为温和的同龄人所表现出的顺从和谦恭。

你是个反对派吗？这也可以成为一种优势，当每个人都告诉你你无法成功时，你的反对派本性结合一点常识就能让你证明他们是错的。那担心呢？作为一个爱担心的人，我会第一个承认，担心确实有一些不健康的方面。但焦虑可以让你通过心理上回顾不同的情境来预测可能性，即使这些情境是负面的。而这并不完全是坏事。稍微担心一下，然后重新构建你的思维以平静你的大脑，就像我们之前讨论的那样，这是个不错的选择。至于天真的梦想家呢？如果你天真，和更务实的人合作是个不错的主意。但一点天真的梦想有助于让世界朝着积极的方向前进。没有人会想放弃这一点。

Based on all of this, what seemingly bad characteristic do you have that might have a good side to them? Join the discussion forum and let other people know and see what intriguing traits other people have.
根据以上内容，你认为自己有哪些看似不好的特质可能也有积极的一面？欢迎加入讨论论坛，与其他人分享，并看看其他人有哪些有趣的特质。



### 3-10 The Intelligence of Emotions

For a long time, emotions were considered unreliable compared with cognition. This has all changed in the last few decades. Emotions are important for social interactions, learning, and decision making. Emotions are complex brain states, associated with positive and negative experiences, and they are accompanied by facial expressions. Darwin wrote a book about visual expression as a form of communication that is important for survival, and natural selection. Paul Ekman is the world's leading expert on facial expression.
长期以来，情绪被认为相较于认知不可靠。但在过去几十年里，这种看法发生了改变。情绪在社交互动、学习和决策中都起着重要作用。情绪是复杂的脑状态，伴随着积极和消极的体验，并伴有面部表情。达尔文曾写过一本关于面部表情作为一种生存和自然选择重要沟通方式的书。保罗·艾克曼是全球面部表情方面的顶尖专家。

He was the real world inspiration for Cal Lightman in the TV drama series Lie to me,although Paul is lot nicer person than Cal.
他是电视剧《谎言之地》中卡尔·莱特曼的现实世界灵感来源，尽管保罗比卡尔要好得多。

Ekman went to Papua New Guinea to find out if pre-industrial cultures responded emotionally with the same facial expressions that we do. He found six universal expressions of emotion in all human societies that he studied. Happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust.
艾克曼前往巴布亚新几内亚，想了解前工业文化是否用与我们相同的面部表情来响应情绪。他发现了六种在他研究的所有人类社会中普遍存在的情绪表达：快乐、悲伤、愤怒、惊讶、恐惧和厌恶。

Emotions are typically slow in onset and can last for a long time. Can you remember the last time that you got angry? How long did the angry mood last?
情绪通常发展缓慢，并且可能持续很长时间。你能记得上一次生气是什么时候吗？那种愤怒的情绪持续了多久？

There are groups of neurons very deep in the brain stem called neuromodulatory systems that control your levels of arousal, motivation, and attention.
大脑干深处有一群神经元，称为神经调节系统，控制着你的唤醒水平、动机和注意力。

Last week, we saw that one of them, the serotonin system, was important for regulating social interactions. Another brain stem system that fans out over wide regions of the brain, uses a chemical called noradrenaline.
上周，我们看到其中一个神经调节系统，即血清素系统，对调节社交互动很重要。另一个在大脑广泛区域扩散的脑干系统使用一种叫去甲肾上腺素的化学物质。

Edronax is a drug that works along the lines of Prozac, except that it is a reuptake inhibitor for noradrenaline, and it increases its activity.
Edronax是一种与普乐可复（Prozac）类似的药物，不同之处在于它是去甲肾上腺素的再摄取抑制剂，并增加其活性。

It could be more effective than Prozac in helping patients who are depressed and lack the capacity for sustained motivation. Whereas, serotonin activation results in serenity and mellowness, noradrenaline activity is involved in increasing drive motivation. When a closely related molecule manufactured in your adrenal gland, called adrenaline, is released in your blood, it makes your heart pound faster and prepares your body for vigorous physical activity, paralleling the increase in mental activity triggered by noradrenaline inside the brain.
它可能比普乐可复（Prozac）更有效，帮助那些感到抑郁并缺乏持续动机的患者。而血清素的活化会导致宁静和温和，去甲肾上腺素的活动则涉及到驱动动机的增加。当一种在你的肾上腺中制造的密切相关的分子——肾上腺素释放到血液中时，它会使你的心跳加速，为剧烈的身体活动做好准备，这与去甲肾上腺素在大脑内触发的精神活动增加相平行。

Is depression caused by imbalances in serotonin or in noradrenaline? These ancient neural systems interact with one another like players in an orchestra. So part of a serotonergic drug's efficacy, may be indirect by altering levels of noradrenaline. This interaction complicates the search for effective treatments for mental disorders, and reminds us, that although we talk about this or that chemical system, brain systems are deeply integrated. There is another powerful motivational system in the brain that uses dopamine, and is centered in the few groups of cells in the midbrain. This system of dopamine neurons underlies both the motivational and the emotional facets of extraversion.
抑郁症是由血清素或去甲肾上腺素的不平衡引起的吗？这些古老的神经系统相互作用，就像乐队中的乐器一样。因此，血清素类药物的部分疗效可能是通过间接改变去甲肾上腺素水平来实现的。这种相互作用使得寻找有效的心理疾病治疗方法变得复杂，同时也提醒我们，尽管我们谈论这个或那个化学系统，但大脑系统是深度整合的。还有另一个强大的动机系统，它使用多巴胺，集中在中脑的少数神经元群体中。这个多巴胺神经元系统支撑了外向性的人格特质的动机和情感方面。

High dopamine levels puts people in a good mood, energizes some people to seek out new worlds, and to go boldly where no one has gone before. But not too high a level since that leads to Tourette Syndrome, characterized by uncontrolled ballistic movements, and a blue streak of swear words, which you can imagine on your own. Your dopamine neurons can be interrogated when you need to make a decision. What should I order from the menu? You imagine each item, and your dopamine cells provide an estimate of the expected reward.
高多巴胺水平使人心情愉快，激励一些人去探索新领域，勇敢地迈向前所未有的地方。但不能过高，因为这会导致妥瑞氏症，其特征是无法控制的突然动作和不断冒出的脏话，这一点你可以想象。在你需要做决定时，你的多巴胺神经元会被激活。例如，当你想从菜单上点菜时，你会想象每个菜品，而你的多巴胺细胞则会提供对预期奖励的评估。

Should I marry this person? Your dopamine cells will give you a gut opinion that is more trustworthy than reasoning.
“我该嫁给这个人吗？”你的多巴胺细胞会给你一个直觉上的看法，这比推理更值得信赖。

Problems with many incommensurate dimensions are the most difficult to decide. For example, how do you trade off a sense of humor, a good dimension, with being messy, a bad dimension? Or hundreds of other comparisons. Your reward system reduces all these dimensions down to a common currency, the transient dopamine signal. Dopamine is a central part of reinforcement learning, which occurs when you associate a sensory input with a reward. Such as Pavlov's dog, in which food odors are are associated with salivation. Dopamine is released in the brain when an unexpected reward occurs, and dopamine levels are reduced from baseline, when an expected reward is not received. Dopamine neurons receive inputs from a part of the brain called the basal ganglia, which evaluates cortical states and assigns value to them, and is involved with learning sequences of motor actions to achieve a goal. Although this form of learning might seem simple, it has now been shown that reinforcement learning is the basis for the most powerful artificial intelligence system ever created. It is not just your cognitive systems, but also the impetus provided by your emotional systems that make you intelligent. Go is an ancient game that is highly popular in Asia. The 19 by 19 Go board is much larger than the 8 by 8 chessboard, which makes it possible to have several battles raging in different parts of the board, white against black pieces, vying for territory.
许多具有不可比性维度的问题是最难决定的。例如，你如何在幽默感（一个优点）和邋遢（一个缺点）之间进行权衡？或者数百种其他比较。你的奖励系统将所有这些维度归纳为一个共同的货币，即瞬时的多巴胺信号。多巴胺是强化学习的核心部分，当你将感官输入与奖励联系在一起时，这种学习就会发生。例如，巴甫洛夫的狗中，食物气味与唾液分泌相关联。当意外奖励发生时，大脑中会释放多巴胺，而当预期的奖励未能获得时，多巴胺水平会从基线下降。多巴胺神经元接收来自大脑一个叫做基底神经节的部分的输入，该部分评估皮层状态并为其分配价值，并参与学习一系列的运动行为以实现目标。虽然这种学习形式看似简单，但现在已显示出，强化学习是迄今为止最强大的人工智能系统的基础。不仅是你的认知系统，还有由你的情感系统提供的动力，使你变得聪明。围棋是一种古老的游戏，在亚洲非常流行。19乘19的围棋棋盘比8乘8的国际象棋棋盘大得多，这使得在棋盘的不同部分可以进行多场战斗，白棋与黑棋争夺领土。

Go is to chess in difficulty, as chess is to checkers. If chess is a battle, Go is a war. It has been thought that Go was so difficult that no computer program could ever play at championship level. However, this changed when the Korean Go world champion played a match with AlphaGo, a program based on reinforcement learning that played itself many millions of times. It came as a shock to many when AlphaGo won the first three games, winning the match, and exhibiting an an unexpectedly high level of play. The three neuromodulatory systems based on serotonin, noradrenaline, and dopamine interact strongly with the emotional systems in the brain. Without them, we would not be human. With them, we are able to form social bonds, evaluate dangerous situations, and learn new skills.

围棋的难度与国际象棋相比，就如同国际象棋与跳棋的关系。如果国际象棋是一场战斗，那么围棋就是一场战争。人们曾认为围棋如此困难，以至于没有任何计算机程序能够达到冠军级别。然而，当韩国围棋世界冠军与AlphaGo进行比赛时，这一观点发生了改变。AlphaGo是一款基于强化学习的程序，它进行了数百万次自我对弈。AlphaGo在首场三局比赛中获胜，并最终赢得比赛，展现出意想不到的高水平表现，这让许多人感到震惊。基于血清素、去甲肾上腺素和多巴胺的三种神经调节系统与大脑中的情感系统有着强烈的相互作用。没有它们，我们就无法成为人类。有了它们，我们能够形成社会纽带、评估危险情况并学习新技能。

I often wondered why Spock, on Star Trek, had such a flat affect. Could it be his neuromodulators were low? Think about it.
我常常想，斯波克在《星际迷航》中为何表现得如此冷淡。他的神经调节剂会不会太低？想一想吧。



### 3-11 Week 3 Wrap Up

This week we've talked about how careers get launched and how your own career can develop and change through your life. Your own internal feelings about what you want to do, of course, can play a critical role in your long term happiness. But society and culture can also have a dramatic affect on your career choices and decisions. As can your parents, family, and friends.
本周我们讨论了职业是如何起步的，以及你自己的职业如何在一生中发展和变化。当然，你对自己想做的事情的内心感受在你长期的幸福中起着至关重要的作用。但社会和文化也会对你的职业选择和决定产生显著影响，父母、家庭和朋友也是如此。

Given all this, and also given the nature of the real world, it's often valuable to carefully assess whether the learning you're doing with relation to your career might be putting you into a passion trap. That is whether you may be pursuing an interest you like, that teachers, professors, friends tell you is great, but which in reality may put you in debt while providing little opportunity for growth or comfort in the long term. Second skilling yourself using a pi rather than a T shaped way of cultivating knowledge related to your career, is a great approach. Sometimes, simply being okay at several or even a lot of things can be better than being a superstar at only one thing. For example, you can be one of the most brilliant coders in the world, but if you don't know how to read people enough to negotiate a good salary, you can't really benefit appropriately from your great skill.
鉴于这一切，以及现实世界的性质，仔细评估与职业相关的学习是否可能让你陷入热情陷阱常常是有价值的。也就是说，你可能正在追求一个你喜欢的兴趣，这个兴趣被老师、教授、朋友告诉你是很棒的，但实际上可能会让你背负债务，同时在长期内提供的增长或舒适的机会很少。以π形而不是T形的方式来提升与职业相关的知识是一种很好的方法。有时，仅仅在多个甚至很多方面做到还不错，可能比在某一领域成为超级明星更好。例如，你可能是世界上最优秀的程序员之一，但如果你不知道如何有效地与人沟通以谈判出一个好的薪水，你就无法真正从你的卓越技能中受益。

Sometimes people you know can be opposed to new learning that you may wish to do, or changes regarding your career. There are three ways to handle this opposition. Dabbling, leading a double life or being a contrarian. All three approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. We learned that sometimes selective ignorance can be better than general competence. After all, you don't want to be caught up fulfilling other peoples' desires while neglecting your own. In fact, sometimes your worst traits can be your best traits. Being disagreeable, a contrarian, a worrier or a dreamer can have positive sides that can be beneficial in the long run. If you use these traits wisely, feeling like an impostor isn't necessarily a bad thing at all. It leaves you more open and flexible, and helps you to avoid the over confidence that can sometimes lead to disaster. We also stepped back to look at the neuroscience of how we interact with others. The three neuromodulatory systems, based on serotonin, noradrenaline, and dopamine, help form the emotional systems of the brain. These systems, in turn, help us to form social bonds, evaluate dangerous situations, and learn new skills.
有时，你认识的人可能会反对你想要进行的新学习或职业上的变化。处理这种反对意见有三种方法：浅尝辄止、过着双重生活或采取反对的态度。这三种方法各有其优缺点。我们了解到，有时选择性无知可能比一般能力更好。毕竟，你不希望被卷入满足他人期望的漩涡中，而忽视了自己的需求。实际上，有时你最糟糕的性格特征也可以是你最好的特征。持不同政见、反对的态度、忧虑或做梦者，这些特质在长期内可能会有积极的一面。如果你明智地利用这些特质，感到像个冒名顶替者并不一定是坏事。这让你更加开放和灵活，并帮助你避免有时会导致灾难的过度自信。我们还退后一步，观察了我们与他人互动的神经科学。基于血清素、去甲肾上腺素和多巴胺的三种神经调节系统有助于形成大脑的情感系统。这些系统反过来帮助我们建立社会联系、评估危险情况和学习新技能。

One more thing. Don't forget the golden rule of career catastrophes. It's never as bad as you think it is at the time and there's always a silver lining. See you next week for the exciting course wrap up.
还有一件事。不要忘记职业灾难的黄金法则：在当时情况并不如你想象的那么糟糕，总会有一线希望。下周见，期待激动人心的课程总结。



### Optional Bonus Video: Nelson Dellis Memory Tips #3

What up everyone? Welcome to another Memory Tips video. My name's Nelson Dells, four time USA member Memory champion. And in this video I'm going to be teaching you how to remember numbers.  So the thing with numbers is that they're hard. A lot of people have difficulty remembering numbers for some reason. It's because numbers are so abstract, right. They're these symbols that represent a number but beyond that they're kind of just a symbol. Individually these symbols, these numbers are meaningless. So the goal with numbers, first and foremost, is to give numbers meaning. Well how do we do that Nelson? I'm going to show you viewer. First thing we need to memorize numbers is a system. We need some way of converting those difficult, abstract symbols, digits, numbers, into something that we can process and then turn into something that we can imagine or visualize. And easiest thing to visualize are words, so we need a system that'll turn numbers into words. And to be able to construct words, we need letters. So I have the perfect system for you. You'll be memorizing numbers in no time I'm going to need some tools let's go.  This is something called the major system.  What'll do is turn each digit 0 through 9 into a consonant sound.  0 is an s or a z sound. 1 is a t or a d sound 2 is an n, 3, m, 4 is an r 5 is an l 6, j, ch, soft g sound. 7 is a k, ch or a hard g sound. 8 is the f or v 9 is p or b. So you need to memorize this first. Let's start with 0 z right? t or d 1 down stroke. You draw a t or d go down. Same with the f you have 2 downstroke m 3 downstroke could slip 3 over 4 ends in r, 5 that's an L right? 5 fingers gives you an L. If i draw J like that Kind of looks like a backwards 6. 7, if I draw a capital K, look at that, that's two 7s, back to back. If I draw a cursive f, it looks like an 8. Finally a 9, flip it, I get p, if I flip that, I get a b, okay. So let's try a number, let's choose say 54. 5 is that L, right? R is the 4. So we have L R, now that opens a bunch of possibilities where we can place the vowels before or in between or after wherever you can come up with a bunch of words Lure ,Lawyer. L(aye)R, L(ai)R, L(au)R(a) And remember, these all go by sound. So even though a word like L(awye)R has awye in between the L and the R, you think, okay, those aren't really vowels although it is a vowel sound. The sound is all that matters, right. So L(awye)R The main consonant sounds that you hear are the L and the R. So, when you hear lawyer, or when you see lawyer, you're going to decipher those two consonant sounds into letters representing 5, 4. Now, that number is going nowhere in your memory unless you would touch to something. So, depending on what you're trying to memorize, if it's a sequence of numbers, we'd have to use maybe your body method or you use a memory palace, like I've talked about in other videos. Or if you're using something, like you're trying to remember a year, or a PIN code, or a birthday, very short numbers that have to be attached to someone, or some fact, or some thing. That's a different process as well and that's probably easier. Let's start with a few examples of how to remember small numbers to singular facts. Let's go. So the first thing I want you to picture is a burger, a hamburger. This hamburger Has arms and he's knocking, like you knock on a front door, on a tick. Like a tiny, little tick, right? So this hamburger is knocking on a tick. So when I say burger, you think knock, tick. If I say knock, tick you can tell me it was a burger. So it works one way or another the image complete together. But one links to the other back and forward and that one was really easy. Well I want you to picture is someone really high up hanging now they are hanging by their nose. Their nose is what holding them up, their hanging from their nose and it's a game, that's important thing. Hanging by your nose, it's a game. All right the next one, I want you to picture, it's very simple image, trading, so you're trading with someone a dog cage. So you have this big wiry dog cage. Maybe there's a dog inside. Maybe it's filthy. And what you're doing is you're trading that dog cage back and forth with someone you give it to them. They give it back to you. All right, the next one, I want you to imagine petting, rubbing your hand against a door that has fumes coming out of it. So maybe you're petting this door and, on the other side, maybe there's a fire maybe there's some gas that's leaking. And there's fumes just emanating out of the sides of the cracks of the door. Pet, door, fume. All right, the next one. I want you to picture a will. So you have this will with all your last wishes. And you're on top of a tower and you lose it. You just drop it. Will, tower, lose. So quick review. We have the burger with the knocking on the tick. Hanging by your nose, it's a game. Trading a dog cage. Petting a door with fumes coming out. And then finally we had a will that you're on a tower, you lose it. Now, so check this out, the five things that you memorize were some of the tallest buildings in the world and their heights.
大家好！欢迎来到另一个记忆技巧视频。我是Nelson Dells，四届美国记忆冠军。在这个视频中，我将教你如何记住数字。

数字的特点就是难记。很多人出于某种原因很难记住数字。这是因为数字是非常抽象的，对吧？它们是代表数字的符号，但除此之外，它们只是符号。单独来看，这些符号、这些数字是没有意义的。因此，记住数字的首要目标是赋予数字意义。那么，Nelson，我们该怎么做呢？我将向你展示。

我们记住数字的第一件事是需要一个系统。我们需要某种方法将那些困难的、抽象的符号、数字转换成我们可以处理的东西，然后转化为我们可以想象或视觉化的东西。而最容易视觉化的就是单词，因此我们需要一个将数字转换为单词的系统。为了构建单词，我们需要字母。所以我有一个完美的系统，您很快就能记住数字，我需要一些工具，让我们开始吧。

这被称为主要系统。这个系统将每个数字（0到9）转换为辅音音素。0是s或z音，1是t或d音，2是n，3是m，4是r，5是l，6是j、ch或软g音，7是k、ch或硬g音，8是f或v，9是p或b。首先，你需要记住这一点。

让我们从0开始，z音，对吧？1的t或d音，画一个下划线。画一个t或d就是往下画。2的n，3的m，4的r，5的l，5根手指给你一个l。如果我这样画j，看看，这有点像倒过来的6。7，如果我画一个大写的K，看看，那就是两个7，背对背。如果我画一个草写的f，它看起来像一个8。最后，9，把它翻转，我得到了p，如果我翻转它，我得到了b。

好的，让我们试一个数字，比如54。5是l，对吧？4是r。所以我们有l和r，现在这打开了许多可能性，我们可以在前面、之间或后面加上元音，随便组合出许多单词，比如lure、lawyer、l(aye)r、l(ai)r、l(au)r(a)。记住，这些都是按声音来判断的。因此，即使像l(awye)r这样的单词在l和r之间有awye，你也要想，好吧，这并不是严格意义上的元音，尽管它是一个元音音。重要的是声音，对吧？所以l(awye)r。你听到的主要辅音音是l和r。因此，当你听到lawyer，或者看到lawyer时，你会将这两个辅音音解码为代表5和4的字母。

现在，这个数字不会在你的记忆中留下深刻印象，除非你将它与某些东西联系起来。根据你试图记住的内容，如果是数字序列，我们可能需要使用你的身体方法，或者像我在其他视频中提到的那样使用记忆宫殿。如果你试图记住的是年份、密码或生日这样的非常短的数字，那么将其附加到某个人、某个事实或某个事物上是一个不同的过程，这可能更简单。

让我们开始一些示例，看看如何记住小数字和单个事实。首先，我想让你想象一个汉堡包，这个汉堡包有手臂，它正在敲一个小钟，就像你敲前门一样，发出“tick”的声音。这汉堡包在敲一个小钟。所以当我说“汉堡”时，你想到的是“敲”、“tick”。如果我说“敲”、“tick”，你可以告诉我这是一个汉堡。这样一来，这个形象就会相互联系。这个联想非常简单。

接下来，我想让你想象一个人高高地挂着，挂着的是他的鼻子。他是用鼻子悬挂的，这个游戏很重要。好吧，接下来，我想让你想象一个简单的图像，交易，一个狗笼。你有一个大的铁丝狗笼，里面可能有一只脏狗。你正在和某人来回交易这个狗笼，你把它给他们，他们又把它还给你。

下一个图像，我想让你想象的是抚摸一扇有烟雾从缝隙中散发出来的门。你可能在抚摸这扇门，而在另一边，可能有火焰或者煤气泄漏，烟雾从门缝中散发出来。抚摸、门、烟雾。

最后，我想让你想象一个遗嘱。你有这个遗嘱，上面写着你所有的最后愿望，而你在一座塔的顶部，把它掉了。遗嘱、塔、丢失。

快速回顾一下：我们有汉堡在敲小钟；挂着鼻子，是个游戏；交易狗笼；抚摸有烟雾的门；最后你在塔上，丢失了遗嘱。现在，看看你记住的这五件事情，它们是世界上最高建筑及其高度。

Now here's how it goes, the first word was a word to help you remember the name of the building. Those are the two words, represented a four-digit number, which represents the height in feet. So, the first one was a burger. So, burj khalifa. And the height of it, knock tick. If we break that down into its consonant sounds, knock which is N and a K sound that's 2 and a 7. Tick which is a 1 and another 7 is 2717. The Burj Khalifa is 2717 feet high. Wow. Tallest building in the word actually. Next one on the list was Hang, hang shang the Shanghai Tower which is in China, Shanghai and you were hanging by your nose and it was a game. For the n and s from the nose that's 2 and a 0 and then game was a 7 was a car or a hard g so that a 7 and end for game is a 3 so 2,073 feet high is Shanghai town. Next trading any guess? One world trade center in New York city. This ones actually pretty easy to memorize without a system. The height of it is 1776, a very memorable year in American history. But if you want to use the system, be consistent what we have was we were trading the dog cage. So dog cage, D is a 1, hard G again is a 7. Cage the cat is a 7 and the soft G is a 6, so 1776 feet high. Next we have pet, you're petting something, it's the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, one of the tallest buildings in the world. What were we petting? A door with fume coming of it, right? So D is 1, R is a 4, that's 14. And then fume is an 8 and a 3 so 1-4-8-3. 1, 483 feet for the Petronas Towers. And finally, Willis Tower formerly known as the Sears Tower the height of that one remember we were at the tower and we lose So Tower is T and R that's 1 and 4 and then lose 5 and 0. So we have 1450 is the Willis Tower. If you do anything you want with dates maybe something happened on a certain date and you memorised the footage year, you can memorize your pin code attached to picture of your bank or whatever institution that your pin number is attached to, you can do for birthday and attach it to the person, the sky is the limit my friend. Thanks for watching this video, next time we're going to dive into how to memorize a really, really, really long list. How do you manage your memory palace for a long list? But for now, I'm out. Stay memorable, thanks for watching. Peace.
现在，让我们来看看如何记住这些建筑的高度。第一个词是一个帮助你记住建筑名称的单词。这两个词代表一个四位数，表示高度（以英尺为单位）。第一个是汉堡，所以是哈利法塔（Burj Khalifa）。它的高度是“敲、滴”。如果我们将其分解成辅音音，"敲"代表n和k音，即2和7。"滴"代表1和另一个7，因此2717。哈利法塔的高度是2717英尺，哇，确实是世界上最高的建筑。

列表中的下一个是上海塔（Shanghai Tower），位于中国上海。你是用鼻子挂着的，而且是个游戏。从鼻子的n和s得到的数字是2和0，而“游戏”的g是7，所以是一个硬g，3则是游戏的结束，所以是2073英尺高的上海塔。

接下来是交易，你猜到了吗？纽约市的一号世界贸易中心（One World Trade Center）。这实际上很容易记住，即使不使用系统。它的高度是1776，这是美国历史上一个非常值得纪念的年份。但如果你想使用这个系统，请保持一致。我们有在交易的狗笼。狗笼的D是1，硬g又是7。笼子里的猫是7，软g是6，所以1776英尺高。

下一个是你在抚摸的东西，那是吉隆坡的双子塔（Petronas Towers），它是世界上最高的建筑之一。我们在抚摸什么呢？一扇有烟雾散发的门，对吧？所以D是1，R是4，所以是14。而“烟雾”是8和3，因此是1483。双子塔的高度是1483英尺。

最后是威利斯塔（Willis Tower），以前称为西尔斯塔（Sears Tower），其高度记得吗？我们在塔上并且丢失了。塔是T和R，这代表1和4，而“丢失”是5和0。因此威利斯塔的高度是1450英尺。

如果你想做任何事情，比如某个日期发生过的事情，你可以记住那个年份的高度，或者将你的PIN码与银行或任何其他机构的图像关联起来，或者将生日与某个人关联，想象力没有限制，我的朋友。

感谢观看这个视频，下次我们将深入探讨如何记住一个非常非常非常长的清单。你如何管理你的记忆宫殿以应对长清单？不过现在，我就先告辞了。保持难忘，感谢观看。再见！



### Optional Bonus Video: Nelson Dellis Memory Tips #4 Remembering Names & Faces

What's up everyone? Welcome to another episode of Random Memory Tips. And in this episode, we're going to talk about how to remember names and faces.  So, how many of you out there think you have an especially poor memory for names and faces?  Probably a lot of you, that's probably the number one request I get is, Nelson how do I remember the names and faces of people I meet. Everybody seems to struggle with names and faces, but why? Why is it that names are so, here's the thing problem with remembering people's names and faces. One is that we're always on the move, right? When we meet people, it's either really quick, it's maybe really loud. The social situation actually dictates how easy or difficult it is to remember someone's name. And because there's people involved, we're often too embarrassed to ask for the name multiple times, or to follow up and really learn the person's name if we missed it or just forgot it really quick. But here's a cool thing, when I started memory techniques I had a bad memory. And especially a bad memory in names and faces, that was one of my worst skills. It turns out that after a number of years of practice I managed to become the top memorizer of names in the entire country. And when I do speeches I frequently will remember the whole room and go around picking people off, telling them what their name was. And I only have to meet them for a matter of seconds beforehand. I tell you that, so that you can realize that someone who didn't have a good memory, especially with names, can turn into someone who is really good at remembering names. Anyways I have five steps that I always follow, when memorizing names, I'm going to share them with you.  All right, step 1, pay attention. I already alluded to this beforehand, but you always have to pay attention. Remembering anything, especially names, will not happen unless your mind is ready to remember this person's name. An easy little tip here to get your mind primed to remember someone's face, is walk into the situation. Whether it's a meeting or you're walking into a party, or someone's about to introduce you. In your mind tell yourself the following phrase. I want to remember this person's name. That's it, if you just did that step alone and didn't even bother with the next four that I'm going to share, you would have a better memory for names, pay attention. All right, step 2 is to choose a feature. Most people might say, choose a feature on the person's face. Try to choose something that doesn't change, like don't use glasses, don't use earrings. I think choose whatever you notice first. If it is a pair of glasses, if it's a mole, if it's their bushy eyebrows, if it's their crazy red curly hair. Even if it's a funny shirt with a seagull on it with a hat, just choose it. It can even be more vague than that, it could be like the way that they walk, manner in which they move their hands. What's important to this is to choose something that you just naturally notice, and that popped out at you first. Why? Because that's probably what's going to pop out at you the next time you see them. All right, step 3, take their name and turn it into a picture. You've mentality primed yourself, you've chosen a feature and now you're going in for the handshake. Now you take that word, and you have to turn that into a picture. So, the first thing you want to do is say to yourself when you hear that name, what does it remind me of? If I heard Bob, for me I would think of a sea bob, so this round bob thing in the water bouncing up and down. Step 4, now this is the crucial step. This is what will cement that name into your memory, and that is where you intertwine steps two and three. Where you take the feature, you take the image, and you just match them together.  Imagine the picture interacting, or living, or being on that feature. So, the final step now is step number 5. And this is where you can consolidate all of that information and try to push it into your long-term memory. Step 5 is to review, and by review, I mean make an extra effort to think about or test yourself on this person's name. The key to having something engrained into your long-term memory is review, unfortunately. That is always going to be the case. The techniques one through four will get you very, very far, but if you want to have an incredible memory where you meet someone a year later. And you remember their names, and you just wow them, that's where a better review comes in. To review, we have those five steps. The first one was, to pay attention. The second one was, choose a feature. The third one was, ask for the name and come up with a picture for that name. Four is to mash the name and the feature together, and then five is review. I want to do some examples, I'm going to have you memorize the names and faces of five different English bulldogs. Why English bulldogs? Well, because they have such friendly faces. And one thing I want to prove to you, is that ideally, with these five steps, you could do this for plants, you could do this for dogs, you could do this for any other animal. You could do this for a bar of soap. But of course you're going to want to use it for real live people. But, if you can do it for the other kinds of things that are a bit crazy, then you for sure will have an awesome memory when it comes time to memorize a person's name. Ready?  All right, so our first bulldog is going to be this guy. Though I might choose, for example, on this guy's left ear. So, I'm going to choose that location, his brown ear there. This guy's name is Brian, and so we need to turn the name Brian into a image. Brian I think of a brain, Brian, brain close enough. So what I'll do is I will plop a peak, fresh out of the skull brain on this bulldog's left ear that's brown. That's it. All right, so the second dog is this guy. Okay, kind of older, much more droopier. And in this case, the feature I'm going to choose for this dog is the fact that his jowls are really, really droopy. And, his name is Edward. When I think of Edward I think of an award. Edward, award, Edward, award, it's close right? So, maybe this dog get's the award for being the droopiest face dog in the history of dog kind. Here's our next dog. All right, and the first thing I notice about this dog is that little snaggle tooth that kind of pops out on the left there. So, this dogs name is, it's a girl, her name is Janice. All I see in this word or hear in this word is nice. Okay, so I'm going to picture that even though she has a snaggle tooth, it's kind of menacing showing that tooth, she's the nicest dog that I've ever met. So with the snaggle tooth, you'd think she bite, maybe, with that sharp tooth. But in fact, she's actually really nice. Our next dog, super cute dog, and the first thing I notice is this dog's tongue just hanging out, and this dog's name is Leah. When I think of the name Leah, I think of Princess Leia. So when I think of Princess Leia, I think of those two buns of hair that she has on her ears. So I'm going to put those two buns on this dog. And she's licking these buns that are on the side of her head like Princess Leia. Our last dog here he is, I'm going to chose over his nose. He kind of has a more pronounced, unusual fold of skin right there. So, I'm going to choose that as his feature. His name is Phillip. Phillip sounds like I'm going to fill something up. And we can imagine filling up that little strip of folded skin, and maybe being filled up with water, or some, filled up with water, right there, that's it. All right, so now let's do a quick test. I'm going to show you these five dogs out of order, and I'll give you a second to say that name out loud and then I'll reveal the answer. Here we go.
大家好！欢迎来到另一个随机记忆技巧的节目。在这一集中，我们将讨论如何记住名字和面孔。那么，有多少人觉得自己在记名字和面孔方面特别差呢？可能很多人，这可能是我收到的第一请求：Nelson，我该如何记住我遇到的人的名字和面孔。每个人似乎都在为名字和面孔而苦恼，但为什么会这样呢？为什么名字这么难记呢？

记住人们名字和面孔的问题有几个。首先，我们总是在移动中，对吧？当我们遇到别人时，情况往往很快，可能也很嘈杂。社交环境实际上会影响我们记住某人名字的难易程度。而且由于涉及到其他人，我们常常因为害怕尴尬而不敢多次询问名字，或者在错过了名字后也不愿意追问并真正记住这个人的名字。

但这里有个很酷的事情：当我开始学习记忆技巧时，我的记忆力很差，特别是记名字和面孔，这是我最差的技能之一。经过多年的练习，我竟然成为了全国记忆名字的顶尖高手。当我演讲时，我常常能记住整个房间的人，并告诉他们的名字，而我只需在之前见他们几秒钟。我告诉你这一点，是让你明白一个曾经记忆力差的人，尤其是在记名字方面，也能变得非常擅长记住名字。

无论如何，我有五个步骤，每次记名字时我都会遵循这些步骤，现在分享给你们。

**步骤1：注意力集中。** 我之前提到过这一点，但你必须时刻保持注意力。记住任何东西，特别是名字，只有在你的脑子准备好记住这个人的名字时才能实现。这里有一个小窍门，可以帮助你准备好记住某人的面孔：进入社交场合，无论是会议、派对，还是有人要介绍你。心里告诉自己一句话：“我想记住这个人的名字。”就这样，如果你只做到这一点而不去管接下来的四个步骤，你的记忆力也会有所提升，专注于注意力。

**步骤2：选择一个特征。** 大多数人可能会说，选择一个人的面部特征。尽量选择那些不会改变的东西，比如不要用眼镜、耳环。我觉得选择你第一次注意到的东西。如果是一副眼镜、一个痣、浓密的眉毛，或者疯狂的红色卷发，甚至是一件印着海鸥的搞笑衬衫，只需选择它。你可以选择更模糊的东西，比如他们走路的方式，或者手的动作。重要的是选择你自然注意到的东西，最先引起你注意的特征。为什么呢？因为那可能是你下次见到他们时首先注意到的东西。

**步骤3：将他们的名字转化为图像。** 你已经准备好了心态，选择了特征，现在要去握手。现在你要将这个名字转化为图像。你要问自己，当你听到这个名字时，它让我想起什么？如果我听到“Bob”，我会想起“海藻”（sea bob），也就是水中上下漂浮的那个圆圆的东西。

**步骤4：这是关键步骤。** 这一步将把名字牢牢地刻在你的记忆中，那就是将步骤二和三结合起来。你要把特征和图像结合在一起。想象这个图像在那个特征上互动、生活或存在。

**步骤5：复习。** 这是将所有信息整合并尝试推入长期记忆的步骤。复习的意思是特别努力地想一想或者测试一下这个人的名字。将某些东西铭刻在长期记忆中的关键是复习，不幸的是，这始终是如此。步骤一到四将使你走得很远，但如果你想在一年后遇到某人时记住他们的名字，并令他们惊叹，那就需要更好的复习。

现在让我们回顾一下这五个步骤。第一步是注意力集中。第二步是选择特征。第三步是询问名字并为该名字想出一个图像。第四步是将名字和特征结合在一起，第五步是复习。

我想做一些例子，我将让你记住五只不同的英语斗牛犬的名字和面孔。为什么是英语斗牛犬？因为它们的面孔非常友好。我想证明的是，理想情况下，使用这五个步骤，你可以对植物、狗、任何其他动物进行记忆。你也可以对一块肥皂进行记忆。但当然，你希望将其用于真实的人。然而，如果你能对其他一些稍微疯狂的东西做到这一点，那么在记住一个人的名字时，你肯定会有出色的记忆。准备好了吗？

好的，我们的第一只斗牛犬将是这只。比如，我可能选择这只狗的左耳。所以，我选择这个位置，他的棕色耳朵。这只狗的名字是Brian，所以我们需要将名字Brian转化为图像。Brian让我想到大脑（brain），Brian和brain非常接近。所以我将在这只斗牛犬的棕色左耳上放一个刚从头骨里出来的脑子。就这样。

第二只狗是这只。这只狗看起来有点老，很多肉。对于这只狗，我要选择的特征是它的下颚非常下垂。它的名字是Edward。当我想到Edward时，我想到的是“奖”（award）。Edward，award，Edward，award，差不多吧？所以，也许这只狗得到了历史上最下垂的脸的奖项。

这是我们的下一只狗。首先，我注意到这只狗的左边有一颗小的尖牙。因此，这只狗是女孩，她的名字是Janice。我在这个词中看到的或听到的是“nice”。所以，我会想象，即使她有一颗尖牙，显得有点吓人，但她是我见过的最可爱的狗。所以，尽管有那颗尖牙，你可能会想她会咬人，但实际上她真的很友好。

我们的下一只狗，非常可爱，我注意到的第一件事是这只狗的舌头在外面垂着。这只狗的名字是Leah。当我想到Leah这个名字时，我想到的是公主莱雅（Princess Leia）。所以，当我想到公主莱雅时，我就会想到她耳边的两个发髻。于是我会把这两个发髻放在这只狗的头上。她在舔着这两个发髻，就像公主莱雅一样。

最后一只狗，我选择了它的鼻子。它有一条更明显、不寻常的皮肤褶皱。所以，我会选择这个特征。它的名字是Phillip。Phillip听起来像是我要填充某样东西。因此，我们可以想象填满那条褶皱的皮肤，或者可能是装满水。

好了，现在我们来做一个快速测试。我将按顺序显示这五只狗，给你几秒钟时间大声说出名字，然后我会揭示答案。准备好了吗？

So that's it guys, that's how to remember names. Just stick to those five tips, when you're in social situation, and I promise you, you will improve. The important thing with names and faces is to try. So often we don't try anymore because we have these devices that can do it for us. Or we simply are too busy with ourselves or other things that we don't even take the time to try and learn a person's name. So take that time, make the effort, use that little thing that's inside your head and try to memorize people you meet. That's it for now, I'll see you in the next video. Thanks for watching, I'm out.
所以就是这样，伙计们，这就是记住名字的方法。在社交场合中坚持这五个技巧，我保证你会有所改善。记住名字和面孔的重要性在于要努力。我们常常不再尝试，因为我们有这些设备可以为我们做这些事情。或者我们只是太忙于自己的事情或其他事务，以至于连花时间去学习一个人的名字都没有。

所以花点时间，付出努力，利用你脑子里的那个小东西，尝试记住你遇到的人。这就是今天的内容，我们下个视频再见。感谢观看，我先走了。

### 4-2 Why Should You Keep Learning?

There are very good reasons to always keep learning throughout your life. We know that there are some 1,400 new neurons that are born everyday in your hippocampus. You can see your brain's hippocampus in red right here. While this image here is actually of a growing neuron. You can see the expansion and the new linkages as it's growing. There's only a modest decline in your neural birth rate as you age. But unless your brain continues to encounter new experiences, which often means learning something new, your new neurons will die off before they mature and hook into that larger neural network. They're kind of like vines that languish and die because there's no trellis. In adults, new neurons allow us to distinguish between similar experiences and store them as distinct memories. This means that for new learning, as well as for mental health, it's important to help new neurons be born, survive, and thrive.
始终保持学习有很好的理由。我们知道，每天在你的海马体中会诞生大约1,400个新神经元。你可以看到海马体在这里以红色显示。这张图片展示的是一个生长中的神经元，你可以看到它的扩展和新的连接。随着年龄的增长，神经元的出生率仅有适度的下降。但如果你的大脑不继续接触新体验，这通常意味着学习新知识，那么这些新神经元将在成熟并与更大的神经网络连接之前就会死亡。它们就像没有支架而枯萎和死亡的藤蔓。对成年人来说，新神经元使我们能够区分相似的经历并将其存储为不同的记忆。因此，为了新的学习以及心理健康，帮助新神经元的诞生、存活和茁壮成长是很重要的。

Of course, we know that physical exercise is one of the most powerful medications we know of that helps produce new neurons. It's as if exercise scatters these sorts of seeds that become neural sprouts. Learning is like water and fertilizer that encourages the growth of those new neural sprouts. The younger you are, the more likely it is that anything you experience is new. As you age it gets easier to fall into a rut. Even when you tell yourself you are learning something new, it's often just a slight riff on something you already know. Learning that makes an impact on the brain often means going just a bit beyond your comfort zone. A useful way to allow new neurons to survive, thrive, and make those new connections is to do something truly new and different every day. This automatically presents your brain with novel experiences. These novel experiences can be as simple as using your left hand to brush your teeth if you're right handed, or just sitting in a different chair at the dinner table. This is also why travel can be so incredibly invigorating. It helps keep the brain tuned up, especially if you do your best to immerse yourself in the new culture and surroundings. Learning a foreign language when you're older may be especially worthwhile, because the areas of the brain that are positively affected by language learning include many of the areas that are negatively affected by aging.
当然，我们知道，体育锻炼是我们所知的最强大的促进新神经元产生的“药物”之一。锻炼就像是播撒种子的过程，这些种子会变成神经芽。学习就像是水和肥料，促进这些新神经芽的生长。你越年轻，经历新事物的可能性就越大。随着年龄的增长，陷入固定模式变得更容易。即使你告诉自己在学习新知识，往往也只是对已有知识的稍微变动。对大脑产生影响的学习通常意味着超出你的舒适区。让新神经元存活、茁壮成长并建立新连接的一个有效方法是每天做一些真正新颖和不同的事情。这自动为你的大脑提供新奇的体验。这些新奇的体验可以是简单的，比如用左手刷牙（如果你是右撇子）或在餐桌上坐在不同的椅子上。这也是为什么旅行如此令人振奋的原因。它有助于保持大脑的活力，尤其是当你尽力沉浸在新文化和环境中时。年纪稍大时学习一门外语可能特别有价值，因为语言学习积极影响的大脑区域，正是许多因衰老而受到负面影响的区域。

In brain terms if you don't use it, you can lose it, no matter how innate and natural your gifts may seem. Widely admired orator Robert Sobukwe who spoke so eloquently for the cause of liberation of black South Africans from the rule of apartheid was subjected to six years of solitary confinement in the same prison that housed Nelson Mandela on remote Robben Island. He could communicate with other prisoners only through furtive hand signals. During this terrible time Sobukwe could feel his powers of speech slipping away. Those who've spent extended periods at isolated locations with few opportunities to speak with others often find themselves stumbling through simple conversations upon their return to civilization. My husband Phil experienced this when he spent a year at remote Siple Station in Antarctica. Hobbies can also help keep us mentally tuned up, especially when those activities are combined with physical exercise. If you knit, sew, quilt, do plumbing or carpentry, play games, use your computer or read, for example, research shows you're more likely to have stronger cognitive ability as you age. These findings make sense. For example, measuring and cutting for either quilting or carpentry clearly help maintain your spatial abilities. There's also evidence that the more you keep up a learning lifestyle, especially as you grow older, the lower your long-term risk of devastating illnesses like Alzheimer's disease.
在大脑的角度来看，如果不使用，就会失去，无论你的天赋看起来多么与生俱来和自然。备受尊敬的演说家罗伯特·索布克威为南非黑人的解放事业做出了精彩的演讲，但他在罗本岛同样的监狱中遭受了六年的独处。在这段可怕的时光里，他只能通过偷偷的手势与其他囚犯沟通。索布克威能感受到自己的语言能力在逐渐流失。那些在隔离地点长时间待着、缺乏与他人交流机会的人，通常在返回文明社会后会发现自己在简单的对话中支支吾吾。我丈夫菲尔在南极的偏远斯普尔站待了一年，也经历过这种情况。

爱好也有助于保持我们的心理活力，特别是当这些活动与体育锻炼结合时。例如，编织、缝纫、拼布、做水管工或木工、玩游戏、使用电脑或阅读，研究表明，这些活动能让你在变老时保持更强的认知能力。这些发现是有道理的。比如，测量和剪裁拼布或木工的过程，显然有助于维持你的空间能力。此外，还有证据表明，保持学习的生活方式，尤其是在年纪增长时，可以降低患阿尔茨海默病等严重疾病的长期风险。

Exercise, learning, and exposure to new environments can help create and nurture new neurons and synapses. These new synapses and neurons create what's called a cognitive reserve. When some synapses and neurons naturally disappear as part of the aging process, you've got others waiting in the wings that can take over the neural pathways and maintain your mental abilities. Researchers are uncovering new ways to help our brains maintain their youthful flexibility even as we age. You might be surprised to hear that action videos can actually be really helpful here. Eventually we may well see video games being prescribed by doctors.
运动、学习和接触新环境可以帮助创造和滋养新的神经元和突触。这些新的突触和神经元形成了所谓的认知储备。当一些突触和神经元在衰老过程中自然消失时，剩下的突触和神经元可以接管神经通路，维持你的智力能力。研究人员正在发现新的方法，帮助我们的脑保持年轻的灵活性，即使随着年龄的增长。你可能会惊讶地发现，动作视频实际上在这方面非常有帮助。未来，我们可能会看到医生开处方视频游戏。



### 4-3 MOOC Tips Part 1 – How to Get the Most from MOOCs

As you might guess, online materials, and MOOCs in particular, are a fantastic way for adults to keep up with a learning lifestyle, whether they're learning for work or for pleasure. This is probably why MOOCs are so very popular. There are thousands and thousands of them out there. So how do you find the ones that are right for you, and how do you take best advantage of them? Here are some quick tips based on super-MOOCer Ronny De Winter's insights. Ronny's a freelance software engineer from Belgium who has completed dozens of MOOCs. First, define what you'd like to learn, either in the short term or more generally in the next two to three years. Next, find the MOOCs or other online learning options that best fit your needs. Class-Central.com can be very useful here. This is a website that has thousands of reviews to help you see what others think about courses. They also have useful rankings, like top 50 MOOCs of all time and features that allow you to search by subject. Before enrolling in any MOOC, carefully investigate the course outline, prerequisites, syllabus, and suggested weekly workload to make sure you can manage it. Schedule enough time each week to work on your learning. To play it safe, it's a good idea to arrange to have twice the recommended time available, just in case. Some people like to listen to videos at anywhere between 1.2 to two times normal speed. More advanced MOOCers can sometimes employ something called Fast-MOOCing. In this approach, you skim through the syllabus and slides before watching the videos. Then you watch the videos at up to double speed. Once you get comfortable doing this, it allows you to cover all the material more efficiently, which can be useful if time is in short supply. Whether you speed things up, though, can depend on the type of material. Some MOOCs on algorithms, math, or physics, for example, might be best done at regular speed. See how things go during the first week. If you you're not getting a lot out of the MOOC, stop taking it. There's no shame in stopping if you realize it's not right for you. Don't enroll in too many courses at the same time. You'll get more out of your learning experience if you study a few subjects deeply rather than many of them superficially. Most MOOCs are frequently repeated, so you can usually take a course some time later if it doesn't fit into your schedule. Use the discussion forum to enhance your learning and to get questions answered; but be aware, this can be time-consuming. You also do want to remember, however, that the more time you devote to active elements of a MOOC, like the discussion forums and projects, the more the material will stick with you. Any time you enroll in a brand new course, you may find it just a bit buggy. So if this bothers you, wait until a later offering. But first time courses can still be fun, so don't discount them altogether. And there you go, advice from the best with practical insights about getting the most from MOOCs. Happy MOOCing.
正如你可能猜到的，在线材料，特别是MOOCs（大规模在线开放课程），是成年人保持学习生活方式的绝佳方式，无论是为了工作还是为了乐趣。这可能就是MOOCs如此受欢迎的原因。网上有成千上万的课程。那么，如何找到适合你的课程，并最大限度地利用它们呢？以下是一些基于超级MOOCer Ronny De Winter的见解的快速提示。Ronny是一名来自比利时的自由软件工程师，他完成了数十个MOOC。

首先，定义你想学习的内容，可以是短期目标或未来两到三年的一般目标。接下来，找到最符合你需求的MOOC或其他在线学习选项。Class-Central.com是一个非常有用的网站，提供成千上万的课程评价，帮助你了解他人对课程的看法。它还有有用的排名，比如“历史上最好的50个MOOC”，以及按主题搜索的功能。

在注册任何MOOC之前，仔细调查课程大纲、先决条件、教学大纲和建议的每周工作量，以确保你能够管理。每周安排足够的时间进行学习，安全起见，最好安排推荐时间的两倍，以防万一。有些人喜欢将视频的播放速度调整到正常速度的1.2到2倍。更高级的MOOCer有时会使用一种叫做快速MOOCing的方法。在这种方法中，你会先浏览课程大纲和幻灯片，然后以高达双倍的速度观看视频。一旦你熟悉了这种方法，就可以更高效地覆盖所有材料，这在时间紧张时尤其有用。

不过，是否加速观看取决于材料的类型。例如，一些关于算法、数学或物理的MOOC，最好以正常速度进行。在第一周看看情况。如果你觉得这个MOOC没有很多收获，可以选择停止。如果你意识到它不适合你，停止是没有羞耻的。不要同时注册太多课程。深入研究几个科目比浅尝辄止地学习多个科目更有收获。大多数MOOC课程会频繁重复，所以如果课程不适合你的时间安排，你通常可以在稍后的时间再选修。

利用讨论论坛增强学习并解决问题，但要注意，这可能会占用很多时间。然而，记住，投入到MOOC的积极元素中，比如讨论论坛和项目的时间越多，材料在你脑中的印记就会越深。每当你注册一门全新的课程时，你可能会发现它有点小毛病。如果这让你感到烦恼，可以等到稍后的课程再选修。不过，首次开设的课程依然可能会很有趣，所以不要完全否定它们。以上就是一些来自最佳实践者的建议，帮助你从MOOCs中获得最多的收益。祝你MOOC学习愉快！



### 4-4 Dirty Little Secrets of Traditional vs Massive Online Teaching

So here I am. This is me, getting ready to go to work at my day job in Michigan. And here's Terry, taking a few minutes off from his day job in La Jolla, California. That's one of the great joys of MOOC making. Co-instructors can work together from afar. I'm just a typical Midwestern engineer, so it was kind of a shocker for me when I was invited to speak at Harvard about our MOOC, Learning How to Learn. I was even more surprised to arrive in Cambridge and see the room packed with Harvard and MIT folks, all eager to learn more about the secret sauce behind the making of our MOOC. Eventually I understood, at least partly, the reason for their curiosity; Learning How to Learn was a labor of love made for less than $5,000. Yet it had on the order of the same number of students as all of Harvard's dozens of MOOCs put together, made for millions of dollars with hundreds of people. This tells you something really important. Making good online learning materials is something anybody can do; but not everybody does it. Here are some dirty little secrets of traditional face-to-face university teaching. There's virtually no competition. Maybe Professor Smith is better than Professor Jones at your local university; but Smith's class is full, so you're stuck with Jones. At many universities, especially the world's elite, the attention goes towards doing great research, not towards doing great teaching. This is why university teaching sometimes just isn't very good. It's a statistical truism, by the way, to say that half of all teachers are below average as teachers. Also, professors become professors because they're good at showing off how much they know. This is often the opposite of what you really need to be a good teacher, where the ability to explain in simple, straightforward ways is vital. Lastly, university teaching is about filling a time slot - say 40 hours in a semester. There is no motivation to be more efficient, to find clever ways to memorably communicate the materials in 25 hours say, instead of 40. But online is a different world. It combines academia with Silicon Valley with a little bit of Hollywood - and there's nothing wrong with that. And unlike regular classrooms, the online world is highly competitive. The bottom line is if you had a choice between a class that taught the material and a class that taught the same material, but where the professor was also funny and brought you onboard with whimsical visual metaphors that helped you quickly grasp key ideas, which class would you choose? Universities can add real value to what you're learning by lending insight from research. Did you know, for example, that research has shown no teacher education courses have been found to have any effect on the quality of teaching? Professors can be nervous about the competition, so some can tend to disparage MOOCs and online learning. They'll say things like MOOCs are bad because they have a low completion rate. However, I would venture to guess that the real completion rate for textbooks; that is, that people have read every chapter and done all the problems, is far lower than the completion rate of MOOCs. Yet professors never say we should get rid of textbooks because of low completion rates. But back to the matter at hand. My point is that though universities can provide invaluable insight into whatever you're trying to learn, they're just not used to competition in teaching. So this is part of why there is such a range of quality in online materials, even from ostensibly top universities. In the next video, I'll give you some insight into how Learning How to Learn was made. This will help set the stage so you can better understand factors to look for in good online learning.
所以我现在在这里，准备去密歇根的日常工作。还有Terry，他在加利福尼亚的拉荷亚休息几分钟。这就是制作MOOC（大规模在线开放课程）的一大乐趣。共同讲师可以在远处合作。我只是一个典型的中西部工程师，因此当我被邀请去哈佛演讲我们制作的MOOC《学习如何学习》时，我感到很震惊。更令我惊讶的是，抵达剑桥时看到房间里挤满了渴望了解我们MOOC背后“秘密配方”的哈佛和麻省理工学院的人员。

最终我部分理解了他们好奇的原因；《学习如何学习》是一次充满热爱的创作，总花费不足5000美元。然而，它的学生人数大约与所有哈佛的MOOC加起来的总数相当，后者的制作成本达数百万美元，参与者却有数百人。这告诉我们一个非常重要的事实：制作好的在线学习材料是任何人都能做到的，但并不是每个人都能做到。

这里有一些传统面对面大学教学的小秘密。几乎没有竞争。也许Smith教授比当地大学的Jones教授更好，但Smith的课程已经满员，所以你只能选Jones。在许多大学，特别是世界顶尖大学，关注的重心是进行伟大的研究，而不是进行伟大的教学。这就是为什么大学教学有时并不好。顺便说一句，统计学上说，所有教师中有一半的教学水平低于平均水平也是事实。

另外，教授成为教授是因为他们擅长展示自己的知识。这往往与成为一名好教师所需的能力相反，后者需要以简单明了的方式进行解释。最后，大学教学只是填补一个时间段——比如一个学期的40小时。没有动力去提高效率，寻找聪明的方法在25小时内有效传达材料，而不是40小时。

但在线教学是一个不同的世界。它将学术界与硅谷和一些好莱坞元素结合在一起——这没有什么错。与常规教室不同，在线世界竞争非常激烈。底线是，如果你可以选择一门课程教你材料，而另一门教同样材料但教授幽默风趣，并通过生动的视觉比喻帮助你快速掌握关键概念，你会选择哪一门课？

大学通过研究提供你学习的真正价值。例如，研究显示，没有一门教师教育课程对教学质量产生任何影响。教授们可能会因为竞争感到紧张，因此有些人可能会贬低MOOC和在线学习。他们会说MOOC不好，因为它们的完成率很低。然而，我敢打赌，教科书的真实完成率——也就是说，所有章节都读过并完成所有问题的比例，远低于MOOC的完成率。然而，教授们从不说我们应该因为低完成率而放弃教科书。

回到正题，我想说的是，尽管大学可以为你尝试学习的内容提供无价的见解，但它们在教学中并不习惯于竞争。这就是为什么即使是声称顶尖大学的在线材料质量差异如此之大的部分原因。在下一个视频中，我将分享《学习如何学习》的制作过程，这将有助于你更好地理解好的在线学习中需要注意的因素。



### 4-5 A Visit to Barb's Basement: The Secret Sauce of Learning How to Learn

And here we are in my basement. This is where we video tape most of learning how to learn and where we're video taping most of Mindshift. Okay, so maybe the basement's a little cleaner than usual. You can see the fireplace mantle is on one side, the door is on the other. As I mentioned earlier, originally I learned everything I needed to know about how to set up a studio and how to edit film by searching things out online. I did most of the video editing for learning how to learn myself with some help from my husband Phil who is also the man behind the camera. It's not like I picked up editing in a second. It took me several months of messing around every spare second I could before I started feeling comfortable with the video editing program. This experience with editing taught me the great value that video editors can bring to the table in MOOC making. You can see, for example, the improvement in the videos in Mindshift versus those of learning how to learn because I'm now working with McMaster's great video editing team. Obviously not all MOOCs are made this way. But looking behind the scenes at our basement, and the scripting and editing process, actually gives you a sense of what's going on behind the scenes in a fair bit of online learning so you can make better decisions about what works for you. You can see the green screen here. It's just a cheap cloth on a frame that we bought online. You can see the rest of the basement around me. There's the teleprompter hood, the edges of the lights here and there's the fireplace and the edges of the room.
在这里我们就在我的地下室。这是我们拍摄《学习如何学习》和《Mindshift》大部分内容的地方。好吧，可能地下室比平时干净一点。你可以看到一侧是壁炉架，另一侧是门。正如我之前提到的，我最初通过在线搜索学习到如何搭建工作室和编辑影片的一切。我自己做了大部分《学习如何学习》的视频编辑，丈夫Phil也在一旁帮忙，他同时也是摄像师。

编辑并不是我一下子就会的。这花了我几个月的时间，在每个空闲的瞬间尝试，才开始对视频编辑程序感到舒适。这个编辑经历让我意识到视频编辑在制作MOOC时能带来的巨大价值。例如，你可以看到《Mindshift》的视频与《学习如何学习》相比有了明显的改进，因为这次我与McMaster大学优秀的视频编辑团队合作。

显然，并不是所有的MOOC都是这样制作的。但从我们地下室的幕后、脚本和编辑过程来看，实际上让你了解在线学习的背后是非常重要的，这样你可以做出更好的决定，找到适合自己的学习方式。你可以看到这里的绿幕，它只是我们在网上买的一块便宜的布架。周围是地下室的其他部分，那里有提词器的罩子、灯光的边缘，还有壁炉和房间的边缘。

How do green screens work? Well, I just stand in front of it like this. Then we crop using a video editing program to get rid of the stuff on the edges. Then we stick whatever background we want behind me, just like the weather person at your local TV station. I can be in the jungle or in the city. We can even just stick in an animation from PowerPoint. This is all a pretty straightforward process, although trust me, just like anyone when I first tried to do it, I had my share of frustrations. Notice the infinite effect that we simulated by just draping the cloth gently forward. You might be surprised to learn that even top notch MOOC making facilities that I've toured around the world often don't have a full length green screen. Why might a full length green screen be important? Because from an evolutionary perspective, things that suddenly loom closer to you were more likely to kill you. So motion that appears to jump closer as when you go from full body to half body on video, activates all sorts of neuro attention layers. Motion of all types, especially unexpected motion really attracts attention. The teleprompter is an interesting story. MOOC makers sometimes advise instructors not to use a teleprompter. This is because some instructors read like this, and their scripts are super pedantic. But the truth is, a good script allows you to carefully plan a MOOC so there isn't a wasted second, and if you review and edit the writing, you can get rid of most of that yucky academic sound. Writing a script gives a great chance to think about the metaphors and seemingly silly stuff that can help quickly convey key ideas. Here, in fact, is the script for Mindshift. Notice my instructions about what I'm supposed to do, or where the images are supposed to go. I can put the script into Word's outlining view. You can see the titles there for each video. Using the outline view allows me to easily rearrange videos as I'm writing the scripts and trying to devise the best ways to convey ideas. There are great books about conventional subjects, introductory statistics or psychology for example but MOOC making is a whole new world. It provides a new canvas for creative ways of teaching and learning. For example, a conventional MOOC on learning on how to learn might have had a week on the history of education, another week on theories of learning, maybe another week on how babies learn. Finally, there might be some information at the end on best practices for learning. There might have been one short video on neuroscience. Nothing too much because after all, neuroscience is complex. But in our learning how to learn, we flipped all that on its head starting from a foundation of neuroscience and using metaphor and humor to spiral the learner quickly through the key ideas. Great MOOCs can synthesize the material in a whole new way. In a way that hasn't previously been done through conventional class work, and that you can't get very easily through books. In our next video, let's take a look what to look for in well made MOOCs.
绿色屏幕是怎么工作的呢？我只需站在它前面，然后用视频编辑程序裁剪掉边缘的东西，之后就可以把我们想要的背景放在我身后，就像你当地电视台的气象主播一样。我可以身处丛林中，或者在城市里，甚至可以插入PowerPoint的动画。这一切都是相当简单的过程，尽管相信我，刚开始尝试的时候，我也遇到了不少挫折。

注意我们通过将布轻轻向前垂挂而模拟的无限效果。你可能会惊讶地发现，即使是我在世界各地参观过的一流MOOC制作设施，通常也没有全身长度的绿色屏幕。为什么全长绿色屏幕会很重要呢？从进化的角度来看，突然靠近你的东西更有可能会伤害你。因此，当视频从全身到半身时，出现的运动会激活各种神经注意层。各种运动，特别是意外的运动，确实会吸引注意力。

提词器的故事也很有趣。MOOC制作人有时建议讲师不要使用提词器，因为一些讲师的朗读方式显得生硬和教条。但实际上，一个好的脚本可以让你精心规划MOOC，确保没有浪费的时间，如果你审阅并编辑写作，可以去掉大多数乏味的学术语言。写脚本是一个很好的机会，可以考虑隐喻和看似无厘头的内容，帮助快速传达关键概念。

事实上，这里是《Mindshift》的脚本。注意我关于该做什么，或者图像应该放在哪里的指示。我可以将脚本放入Word的提纲视图中。你可以看到每个视频的标题。使用提纲视图可以让我在写脚本和试图构思最佳表达方式时，轻松调整视频的顺序。

关于传统主题的优秀书籍，比如入门统计学或心理学，但MOOC制作是一个全新的世界。它提供了一个创意教学和学习的新画布。例如，传统的学习如何学习的MOOC可能会有一周讲述教育史，另一周讲学习理论，可能还有一周讲述婴儿如何学习。最后，可能在结尾提供一些关于学习最佳实践的信息，可能还有一段简短的视频介绍神经科学，但不会太多，因为毕竟神经科学是复杂的。而在我们的《学习如何学习》中，我们颠覆了这一切，从神经科学的基础出发，利用隐喻和幽默迅速引导学习者理解关键概念。

优秀的MOOC能够以全新的方式综合材料，这种方式在传统课堂上并未被充分实现，而通过书籍你也很难获得。在下一个视频中，让我们看看如何识别制作精良的MOOC。


### 4-6 MOOC Tips Part 2 – Looking More Deeply Into Quality Learning

The easiest way to decide whether an online learning experience is right for you is to check out an online ranking site. As I've mentioned before, I personally like to use classcentral.com. It has a smart way of comparing MOOCs across different platforms by letting you see people's reviews. Fun game-like aspects, and easy to follow course structure, and thoughtfully designed quizzes, tests, and projects are obviously important in any online course. But here are some other valuable MOOC making elements that can make a difference in how well you learn and how much you enjoy the learning process.
选择合适的在线学习体验最简单的方法是查看在线排名网站。正如我之前提到的，我个人喜欢使用 classcentral.com。这个网站通过让你查看人们的评价，以智能的方式比较不同平台上的MOOC。课程的趣味性、易于跟随的结构以及经过深思熟虑的测验、测试和项目显然在任何在线课程中都很重要。不过，还有一些其他宝贵的MOOC制作元素，它们会影响你的学习效果和学习过程的乐趣。

Research has shown that if you watch a professor on a video for about 30 seconds, you can get a very good sense of how effective that professor actually is. Amazingly, even as little as six seconds can allow you to form an effective snap judgement, in part based on emotional micro expressions that are too fast to truly register. Look for approachable, encouraging, fun professors who can simplify the material and make the hard stuff look easy. It may seem obvious that all professors should be this way, but they aren't. It turns out that when we understand something through a metaphor, we're putting into action the same neural circuitry that we use to understand the in-depth concept itself. Traditional teachers sometimes believe that teaching through metaphor dumbs things down. Smart teachers, however, realize that metaphor and analogy can help students get an initial grasp of the materials much more quickly. Good online courses often use lots of vivid metaphors and analogies. Incidentally, if you yourself can come up with a metaphor, the sillier the better, it can often help you understand even difficult concepts like those in advanced calculus. Did you know that equations themselves are actually just metaphors? That's according to Emanuel Derman, one of the world's greatest mathematical modelers. Whenever a metaphor breaks down, throw it away and then just get a new one.
研究表明，如果你观看一位教授的视频约30秒钟，就能很好地判断这位教授的有效性。令人惊讶的是，甚至短短六秒钟就可以让你形成有效的瞬时判断，这在一定程度上是基于那些快速而微妙的情感表情，难以真正捕捉。寻找那些亲切、鼓励、幽默的教授，他们能够简化材料，使复杂的内容变得容易理解。

这似乎是显而易见的，但实际上并非所有教授都具备这样的能力。研究发现，通过隐喻理解事物时，我们在激活与理解深入概念相同的神经通路。传统教师有时认为通过隐喻教学会降低教学水平。然而，聪明的教师意识到，隐喻和类比可以帮助学生更快地初步掌握材料。优秀的在线课程往往使用大量生动的隐喻和类比。

顺便提一下，如果你自己能够想出一个隐喻，越愚蠢越好，往往能帮助你理解一些困难的概念，比如高等微积分。你知道吗，方程本身实际上也是隐喻？这是世界上最伟大的数学模型师之一Emanuel Derman的观点。每当一个隐喻失效时，就抛弃它，然后想出一个新的。

Online materials with humor can help activate addictive dopamine circuits of pleasure. It also provides the mental equivalent of a sort of ledge to temporarily rest on and regain your breath when you're climbing an intellectual mountain.
带有幽默感的在线材料可以激活令人上瘾的多巴胺回路，带来愉悦感。这也为你提供了类似于一个临时休息的平台，让你在攀登智力高峰时可以稍作喘息和恢复精力。

In my experience, humor's much more important in online courses than in face to face classes. If you have a competitive choice between a class that presents the material and a class that is funny while it presents the material, which one are you going to take? Look for well done visuals that relate directly to the material. A little clip art is understandable, but it shouldn't all just be clip art. If the instructor can't take the time to help develop illustrations, it tells you a lot about how invested that instructor and their institution are in the course. On the other hand, just slapping a complex textbook image on the screen also just doesn't cut it. People learn differently from videos than they do from books. Complex images need to appear part by part. You'll learn better in the same amount of time if you're not hit visually with everything all at once. If intelligently done and not just done for style's sake, good editing keeps your attentional circuits in gear while adding to your comprehension. The best MOOCs showcase the talent of video editors and instructional designers. There will undoubtedly be many other approaches to MOOC making that you find very helpful. Please head on over to the discussion forums and let us know what you think some of these best approaches are. Please tell us some of your favorite MOOCs and why you like them.
在我看来，幽默在在线课程中比面对面的课堂更为重要。如果你有机会选择一门讲授材料的课程和一门在讲授材料时又很幽默的课程，你会选择哪一门？寻找那些与课程内容直接相关的精美视觉效果。适量的剪贴画是可以理解的，但不应全部依赖剪贴画。如果讲师连开发插图的时间都不愿意花，这就说明了他们和他们所在机构对课程的投入程度。另一方面，简单地将复杂的教科书图像放在屏幕上也不够有效。人们从视频学习的方式与从书本学习的方式不同。复杂图像应分部分呈现。若能在同样的时间内避免一下子视觉轰炸，你的学习效果会更好。如果编辑得当，而不是单纯追求风格，良好的编辑可以保持你的注意力，同时提升理解力。最优秀的MOOC展示了视频编辑和课程设计的才能。你也可能会发现许多其他有帮助的MOOC制作方法。请前往讨论论坛，与我们分享你认为的一些最佳方法，并告诉我们你最喜欢的MOOC以及原因。



### 4-7 Mentors in Your Life

There is one important aspect of learning, that we haven't yet touched on. Yet it can be one of the most important aspects of learning of all. That is mentors. Mentors aren't necessarily parent-like figures who spend many hours brainstorming and guiding you to your future. In fact, a mentor can be as simple as someone who says, or does, something that causes you to think and make valuable changes. Or, who gives you insight about your life. You don't even have to meet a mentor in person. It's not that mentors can, or even should, tell you what you should be doing. It's that mentors can help you view the world in a different way, so you can more easily discover and go in the direction you determine is best for you, not to mention that they can have ideas and context that can change your life.
学习中还有一个重要方面，我们还没有提到。这个方面可能是学习中最重要的之一，那就是导师。导师不一定是像父母一样的人物，他们花很多时间帮助你规划未来。实际上，导师可以是任何一句话或一个行为，让你思考并做出有价值的改变的人。或者是给予你生活洞察的人。你甚至不必与导师面对面交流。

导师并不是告诉你该做什么的人，而是帮助你以不同的方式看待世界，让你更容易发现并走向你认为最适合自己的方向。此外，他们可能会提供改变你生活的想法和背景。

Our lives are filled with a wide variety of mentors who help us in many ways large and small. Even rude and mean people can be mentors to us since they can show us what we don't want to be like ourselves. And sometimes their feedback and thoughts although painful can be helpful in the grand scheme of things. Arnim Rodeck, for example, was an electrical engineer who made an enormous career change when he decided to become a creative wood worker, a craft at which he would eventually become world class. Arnim differentiates his mentors into two different types.
我们的生活中充满了各种各样的导师，他们在许多方面以大小不一的方式帮助我们。甚至粗鲁和恶劣的人也可以成为我们的导师，因为他们可以让我们看到自己不想成为的样子。有时，他们的反馈和想法虽然痛苦，但在整体上可能是有帮助的。

例如，阿尔宁·罗德克（Arnim Rodeck）是一位电气工程师，他在决定转行成为一名创意木工时经历了巨大的职业变革，并最终在这一工艺上达到了世界级水平。阿尔宁将他的导师分为两种不同类型。

Hi there, there are several type of mentors, the ones who actually pump us up and energize us, or the ones who actually could be much more critical and actually won't tolerate any excuses. They might be much more stern and demanding people but at the end of the day, the insight we gain from them is invaluable. Mentors can even be online nowadays. For example, in learning experiences as different as acquiring a new language or training a horse, you may interact with a mentor who lives far away from you. My co-instructor, Terry Sejnowski, also has some thoughts here.
嗨，导师有几种类型，有的能真正激励我们，让我们充满活力；而有的则可能更为挑剔，根本不容忍任何借口。虽然他们可能更加严厉和要求苛刻，但最终我们从他们身上获得的见解是无价的。如今，导师甚至可以是在线的。例如，在学习新语言或训练马匹等不同的学习经历中，你可能会与一个远在他乡的导师互动。我的合伙讲师，特里·塞诺斯基（Terry Sejnowski），在这方面也有一些看法。

The brain works best with concrete examples not abstract aspirations. A good place to start reinventing yourself is to ask, who has had the most influence on my life and who has inspired me to start a new life?
大脑在具体示例面前工作得更好，而不是抽象的愿望。重新塑造自己的一个好起点是问自己：谁对我的生活影响最大？谁激励我开始新的生活？

Influential mentors have motivated me to become who I am today.
有影响力的导师激励我成为今天的自己。

In high school, I joined the radio club and I learned electronics and Morse code. The radio club had tracked the Sputnik, the first satellite to circle the earth at a time when the US was taken by surprise. I was asked, what is your mission? We all have a mission in life but if you don't ask yourself the question, you may never find the answer. I still ask myself this question because the answer keeps changing.
在高中时，我加入了广播俱乐部，学习了电子学和摩尔斯电码。广播俱乐部曾追踪过斯普特尼克号，这是第一个环绕地球飞行的卫星，当时美国对此感到震惊。我被问到：你的使命是什么？我们每个人都有生命中的使命，但如果你不问自己这个问题，你可能永远找不到答案。我仍然在问自己这个问题，因为答案在不断变化。

Asking yourself the right question about your life is half the battle, where do I want to be next month or next year? This will shape what skills you'll need and what steps you should take to acquire them.
问自己关于生活的正确问题是战斗的一半，我想在下个月或明年在哪里？这将决定你需要什么技能，以及应采取什么步骤来获取这些技能。

Persistence is a virtue. Don't let setbacks keep you back.
坚持是一种美德。不要让挫折阻止你前进。

Motivation can also come from working closely with someone who shares the same goals. Projects with short-term goals can focus the mind wonderfully. The persistence needed to achieve long term goals can be sustained by collaborations that are more like marriages.
动力也可以来自与分享相同目标的人紧密合作。短期目标的项目可以极大地集中思维。实现长期目标所需的坚持可以通过更像婚姻的合作关系来维持。

These relationships can be the most satisfying, choose them wisely.
这些关系可能是最令人满意的，选择时要谨慎。

Mind shifting may mean re-evaluating your relationships, finding new short-term collaborations, and cultivating longer-term ones that take you in new directions.
思维转变可能意味着重新评估你的关系，寻找新的短期合作，培养能带你走向新方向的长期关系。

A word of advice, it's unwise to approach a person you don't know and ask them to be your mentor. This can put that person in an uncomfortable situation, after all they have no idea what your expectations of a mentor are. And truthfully, they have no idea whether you might be a fit for them. In fact, it's often better to avoid asking someone to be your mentor, even if you consider them to be a mentor to you. If the fit is right, a relationship will develop organically, and in the course of this relationship, you may only get tiny snippets of occasional insight from your mentor. But this can still be very valuable. Because while these snippets may take only a few seconds for the mentor to say, they can nevertheless have a profound influence on you and your career. So don't discount the importance of even the most trivial seeming exchanges with someone you consider a mentor. Finally, if it seems reasonable look for ways to make yourself somehow useful to your mentor. Just as they are for you. Ensuring that the benefits of the relationship go both ways will make it that much stronger. And if you've had a positive mentoring experience, look for ways to pay it forward by mentoring others in ways similar to the mentoring that has helped you.
给你一个建议，接触一个你不认识的人并请求他们成为你的导师是愚蠢的。这会让那个人感到不舒服，毕竟他们不知道你对导师的期望是什么。老实说，他们也不知道你是否适合他们。事实上，通常更好的做法是避免直接请求某人成为你的导师，即使你认为他们是你的导师。如果关系合适，它会自然发展。在这个过程中，你可能只会从你的导师那里获得偶尔的、微小的洞见。但这些依然非常宝贵。因为尽管这些片段可能只需要几秒钟的时间让导师说出，但它们仍然能对你和你的职业产生深远的影响。因此，不要低估与某个你认为是导师的人之间即使是最琐碎的交流的重要性。最后，如果合适的话，寻找方法让自己对你的导师有所帮助。就像他们对你一样。确保关系的好处是双向的，这会让它更加牢固。如果你有过积极的指导经验，也要寻找机会以类似的方式回馈他人，成为他们的导师。



### 4-8 Read, Read, Read


My friend, Jake Taylor is a professional investor who also runs a website called Five Good Questions and online series dedicated to interviewing interesting authors and creating more inspired readers. Back when he was in business school, Jake won a long shot lottery to have lunch with Warren Buffett. Those six hours together with Warren Buffett transformed Jake's life. After meeting Mister Buffett, I couldn't stop wondering how one man had accumulated so much knowledge in one lifetime. I started reading everything I could get my hands on about him. And after about a decade now, I think I've finally unlocked what his magic is.
我的朋友杰克·泰勒是一位专业投资者，同时还运营着一个名为《五个好问题》的网站和在线系列，专注于采访有趣的作者，激励更多的读者。在他商学院的时候，杰克赢得了一次与沃伦·巴菲特共进午餐的长途彩票。与沃伦·巴菲特的六小时相处彻底改变了杰克的生活。遇到巴菲特后，我不禁思考，一个人是如何在一生中积累如此多的知识的。我开始阅读关于他的所有书籍。经过大约十年的时间，我觉得我终于揭开了他的“魔法”。

The truth is, is that although he and his business partner, Charlie Munger have incredibly high IQs, their real competitive advantage comes from all the books that they read. These guys are nonstop readers. If you want to be the smartest person in the room, it's pretty simple. Just read more than everyone else. Now  and you may say, it is difficult to find time to read. But if you can carve out 20 minutes a day, that will lead to 35 books read in 1 year.
事实是，尽管沃伦·巴菲特和他的商业伙伴查理·芒格的智商极高，但他们真正的竞争优势来自于他们阅读的书籍。这些人是阅读不止的书虫。如果你想成为房间里最聪明的人，其实很简单。只需比其他人读得更多。你可能会说，很难找到时间阅读。但如果你每天能挤出20分钟，那一年就能读完35本书。

So imagine yourself a year from now, when you've read 35 book, how much smarter you'll be? Now, think about yourself 3 years out and the 100 books that you'll have read over that time.
想象一下，一年后你读完了35本书，你会变得多么聪明？现在再想想三年后的自己，那时你将读完100本书。

All of this compounds out into a richer and more successful life with better decision-making all along the way. So if I could say, there was one hack, I would say, it's to read more than everyone else. One controlled study of well over 3,000 participants found that book readers have a survival advantage over those who read only newspapers or magazines, or who didn't read much at all. Basically, book readers showed about a 20% reduction in risk of mortality over the 12 years of followup compared to non-book readers. There's something about book reading that is especially healthy. We talked about the importance of metaphor in learning. Here's something to think about if you're trying to be creative, as well as knowledgeable about a field. Let's say that you're trying to understand the best approaches to investing. So you read all the most famous books on investing and many other books on investing, as well. What you don't tend to think about is that everybody else who's interested in investing is doing pretty much the same thing. So, the same input can mean much the same output. Meaning that you won't really have much of an advantage on everyone else. However, if you make a habit of reading not only within your discipline or subject area, but also devoting a little time to reading and learning something completely unrelated, at least it seems that way. You have a much better chance of bringing creative new approaches and ideas to the discipline through the metaphors that will naturally develop in your mind. This could be what else ends up giving you that extra edge. In this MOOC, we've placed a lot of emphasis on online learning, but don't forget the value of reading good books in helping you to keep up with life long learning. Do you have a favorite book or author who's impacted your learning, the quality of your life or your understanding of life and your place in it? Head on over to the discussion forum and let us know what you think, and learn as well from the top insights of professors.
所有这些都会汇聚成更加丰富和成功的生活，使你在决策时更加明智。因此，如果我只能说一个窍门，那就是要比别人多读书。一项对3000多名参与者的控制研究发现，读书的人比那些只读报纸或杂志的人，或者不太读书的人有更高的生存优势。基本上，书籍阅读者在12年的随访中，与非书籍阅读者相比，死亡风险减少了约20%。阅读书籍的确有助于健康。

我们谈到了隐喻在学习中的重要性。如果你想要在某个领域既具创造力又有知识，可以考虑这样一个问题：假设你想了解投资的最佳方法，于是你阅读了所有著名的投资书籍，以及许多其他相关书籍。然而，你可能没有想到的是，所有对投资感兴趣的人几乎都在做同样的事情。因此，相同的输入可能意味着相同的输出，这意味着你不会真正比别人占有什么优势。

然而，如果你养成不仅在自己专业领域内阅读的习惯，还花一点时间去阅读和学习完全无关的内容，你就有更大的机会通过自然产生的隐喻，为你的领域带来创造性的新的方法和想法。这可能就是让你获得额外优势的关键。

在这门MOOC中，我们强调了在线学习的重要性，但不要忘记阅读好书在终身学习中也有很大的价值。你有没有喜欢的书籍或作者，对你的学习、生活质量或对生活及自己在其中位置的理解产生过影响？请到讨论论坛分享你的看法，并向教授们学习他们的最佳见解。



### 4-9 Surviving in the New Information Economy


It never occurred to me that I would someday become omniscient, which I have for all practical purposes. Information flows through the Internet at the speed of light. We are living through an explosion of information in its many forms. The economy is going digital, and programming skills are in great demand at many companies. As the world shifts from an industrial economy to an information economy, education and job training will have to adapt. We are witnessing the beginning of a major shift in how we live. The Age of Information will have as profound an impact on society by enhancing our cognitive abilities, as the Industrial Revolution had 250 years ago by enhancing physical power. The timetable for this transformation will be much more rapid than the Industrial Revolution, which took 100 years for the world to adapt to machines. The Information Age will play out over the next few decades. We heard last week that the South Korean Go champion was beaten by AlphaGo, an artificial intelligence program based on deep learning that was bio-inspired. Learning in deep neural network models has become possible because of the million times increase in computer power since the 1980s. Deep learning has made it possible to reach human levels of performance in speech recognition and object recognition in images. As we reverse engineer the brain's learning systems, we are also gaining new insights into human intelligence. Nature evolved learning as a way for a broad range of problems to be solved by experience with the world, and humans learn faster and more deeply than any other species. Google recently released a new version of Google Translate based on deep learning, which was a quantum leap in the quality of translation between natural languages. Literally overnight, language translation went from a fragmented, hit-or-miss jumble of phrases to seamless sentences. Previous methods searched for combinations of words that could be translated together, but deep learning looks for dependencies across whole sentences. When you use an Android cell phone to transcribe speech, you are using deep learning. When speech recognition is combined with language translation, it will become possible to communicate across cultures. Star Trek's universal translator is within our reach. An even larger disruption is beginning to affect service industries and professions, as machine learning matures and is applied to many other problems where big data are available. Medical diagnosis based on the records of millions of patients will become more accurate. A recent study applied deep learning to a medical database of dermatological images for over 2000 different skin diseases. The network was trained to diagnose these diseases. Performance was comparable to that of expert dermatologists. It should now be possible for anyone with a smartphone to take a photo of a suspicious skin lesion and have it diagnosed instantly in the cloud, a process that now requires a visit to a doctor's office, a long wait for the lesion to be screened by an expert, followed by a substantial bill. This will greatly expand the scope and quality of dermatological care. Deep learning is just beginning to affect the legal profession. Much of the routine work in law offices that charge hundreds of dollars an hour will become automated. Complying with the increasing regulatory complexity will also benefit from automated systems. Legal support will be available for the average person who cannot now afford a lawyer. Not only will legal work be cheaper, it will be much faster, a factor that is often more important than the expense. Deep learning will have an even bigger impact on your everyday life. As you interact with the Internet, you are generating data about yourself that is machine-readable. This can be used to create a personal assistant that knows you better than anyone else in the world, and will not forget anything. Your children will have their own personal tutors who'll accompany them throughout their education. The educational opportunities for the children of today's children will be better than the best education available today to wealthy families. As these new technologies mature, the new jobs that will be opening up will require new skills. The steam engine displaced human labor, but created jobs for engineers who could build and service steam engines. As jobs that now require cognitive skills are taken over by automated AI systems, there will be new jobs for those that can create and maintain these systems. These new jobs will require new skills. So, be prepared for a lifetime of learning.
我从未想过自己有一天会变得无所不知，但从实际意义上来说，我已经达到了这个状态。信息通过互联网以光速流动。我们正经历信息以多种形式的爆炸式增长。经济正在数字化，编程技能在许多公司中需求旺盛。随着世界从工业经济转向信息经济，教育和职业培训也必须适应这种变化。我们正在见证生活方式的重大转变的开始。信息时代将通过增强我们的认知能力，对社会产生深远的影响，就像250年前工业革命通过增强身体力量所带来的影响一样。这一转变的时间表将远比工业革命要快，后者让世界适应机器用了100年。信息时代将在未来几十年内展开。

上周我们听说，韩国围棋冠军被基于深度学习的人工智能程序AlphaGo击败。自1980年代以来，计算机性能的提升使得深度神经网络模型的学习成为可能，增加了百万倍。深度学习使得在语音识别和图像对象识别上达到人类水平的表现成为可能。随着我们对大脑学习系统的逆向工程，我们也获得了对人类智能的新见解。自然进化出学习能力，使广泛的问题能够通过与世界的经验解决，而人类的学习速度和深度超过任何其他物种。

谷歌最近发布了基于深度学习的新版本谷歌翻译，这在自然语言之间的翻译质量上实现了质的飞跃。语言翻译从以往零散的、偶然的短语 jumble，变成了无缝的句子。之前的方法寻找可以一起翻译的单词组合，而深度学习则寻找整句之间的依赖关系。当你使用Android手机进行语音转录时，你就是在使用深度学习。当语音识别与语言翻译结合时，跨文化交流将成为可能。《星际迷航》的通用翻译器就在我们触手可及之处。

随着机器学习的成熟，越来越大的破坏性正在影响服务行业和职业，许多其他大数据问题也将得以应用。基于数百万患者记录的医疗诊断将变得更加准确。最近的一项研究对2000多种皮肤疾病的皮肤病学图像医疗数据库应用了深度学习。该网络被训练用于诊断这些疾病，性能与专家皮肤科医生相当。现在，任何拥有智能手机的人都可以拍摄可疑皮肤病变的照片，并在云端即时获得诊断，而这一过程现在需要到医生办公室就诊，等待专家筛查病变，之后还要支付高额费用。这将大大扩展皮肤病学护理的范围和质量。

深度学习刚刚开始影响法律职业。收费数百美元每小时的律师事务所的许多常规工作将会自动化。遵守日益增加的监管复杂性也将受益于自动化系统。法律支持将面向那些现在无法负担律师费用的普通人。不仅法律工作将变得更便宜，速度也将更快，而速度往往比费用更重要。

深度学习将在你的日常生活中产生更大的影响。当你与互联网互动时，你正在生成关于自己的机器可读数据。这可以用来创建一个了解你比任何人都更透彻的个人助理，并且不会忘记任何事情。你的孩子将拥有自己的个人辅导员，伴随他们完成整个教育过程。如今孩子们的教育机会将比今天富裕家庭获得的最佳教育更好。随着这些新技术的成熟，将会出现需要新技能的新工作。蒸汽机取代了人类劳动，但为能够建造和维修蒸汽机的工程师创造了就业机会。随着现在需要认知技能的工作被自动化的人工智能系统接管，将会有新工作为能够创建和维护这些系统的人提供。

这些新工作将需要新技能。因此，要为终身学习做好准备。



### 4-10 Week 4 Wrap Up

As we learned in this final week, new neurons are being born every day in the hippocampus, the critical area of your brain for learning and memory. But new learning is needed to provide a trellis that allows these new neurons to survive, thrive, and grow. Learning can help keep you physically as well as mentally healthy both in your youth and your maturity. Without new learning, especially in ways that can take you outside your comfort zone, you can become inflexible and set in your ways. That's never a good idea. Of course, one of the best ways to keep learning is to use MOOCs. We even walked behind the scenes in MOOC making so you could be a better judge of how good online learning is created. Metaphors, humor, and great video editing go a long way to create optimal learning experiences, whether you're studying subjects as different as calculus or bonsai. And mentors, whether the type that pumps you up or the type that tolerates no excuses, can take your learning to an even higher level. Persistence is a virtue. Don't let setbacks keep you back. Sporadically check your internal compass by asking yourself what is your mission. We learned how important it is to use a good online class search engine like Class Central that allows you to compare ratings. We also learned about techniques like fast-MOOCing and balancing how many MOOCs you take. Well-done online learning can actually be better than in-class learning. The online combination of academia with Silicon Valley and a little bit of Hollywood can keep you interested and engaged in ways that regular face-to-face courses have trouble with. With online, you have more choice to find the best teachers and approaches. Of course, there are other great ways to keep up with the learning lifestyle. One of the best ways is to read a book. 20 minutes a day of reading can help you to be the smartest person in the room. Surviving in the new information economy isn't necessarily easy. Much disruption lies ahead in virtually every industry, but with disruption comes plenty of opportunity. This week, we've given you some powerful tools to help take advantage of those opportunities.
正如我们在最后一周所学到的，每天都有新的神经元在海马体中诞生，这是大脑中负责学习和记忆的关键区域。但新学习是必要的，它为这些新神经元提供了生存、繁荣和成长的支架。学习不仅有助于保持身体健康，还有助于心理健康，无论是在青春期还是成熟期。没有新的学习，尤其是能够让你走出舒适区的学习，你可能会变得僵化和固执，这绝不是一个好主意。

当然，保持学习的最佳方式之一是利用MOOC（大规模在线开放课程）。我们甚至深入了解了MOOC的制作过程，以便让你更好地判断高质量的在线学习是如何创造的。隐喻、幽默和出色的视频编辑在创造最佳学习体验方面都起到了很大作用，无论你学习的主题是微积分还是盆栽艺术。无论是激励你的人还是严厉的导师，都能将你的学习提升到更高的水平。坚持不懈是一种美德，不要让挫折阻碍你。

定期检查你的内心指南针，问自己，你的使命是什么。我们了解到，使用像Class Central这样的优秀在线课程搜索引擎是多么重要，它可以让你比较评分。我们还学习了快速MOOC和如何平衡所选MOOC数量的技术。优秀的在线学习实际上可以优于课堂学习。在线学习结合了学术界、硅谷和好莱坞的一点点元素，可以让你以常规面对面课程难以做到的方式保持兴趣和参与感。在在线学习中，你有更多的选择，能够找到最佳的教师和学习方法。

当然，还有其他优秀的方式可以保持学习的生活方式。其中最好的方式之一是阅读一本书。每天花20分钟阅读可以帮助你成为房间里最聪明的人。在新的信息经济中生存并不一定容易。几乎每个行业都面临巨大的变革，但变革也带来了大量的机会。本周，我们为你提供了一些强大的工具，以帮助你抓住这些机会。



### 4-11 Finale: Discovering Your Hidden Potential

I was inspired to create this movie because I've had a second chance at life. Long after I was supposed to be set in my career and set in my ways, I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to transform myself from a person whose only apparent talent was in language and the humanities. I began a new career trajectory that eventually led to my becoming a professor of engineering.
我受到启发创作这部电影，因为我获得了生活的第二次机会。在我本该在职业上稳定、安于现状的很长一段时间后，我有幸得到了机会，将自己从一个看似只有语言和人文学科天赋的人转变为工程学教授，开启了一条新的职业轨迹。

This book's subtitle is Break Through the Obstacles to Learning and Discover Your Hidden Potential. This covers enormous scope, but especially when we delved into the science, a common thread became clear. People could often do more, change more, and learn more often, often far more than they ever dreamed possible. Our potential is hidden in plain sight, all around us.
这本书的副标题是《突破学习障碍，发现你隐藏的潜能》。这个主题涵盖了广泛的内容，但尤其是当我们深入科学时，一个共同的主题变得清晰可见。人们往往能够做得更多、改变更多、学习更多，常常远超过他们曾经想象的可能性。我们的潜能就隐藏在我们周围，显而易见。

There are two overlapping aspects of learning and we've explored both in this MOOC. The first is to realize that mindshift, deep changes in life that occur through learning, is something that can be done at any age with any goal in mind. Well-made MOOCs and other dynamic learning experiences show us how powerful, fun, and even addictive learning can be. And importantly, life long learning also keeps our minds fresh as we age.
学习有两个重叠的方面，我们在这个MOOC中都进行了探讨。第一个是意识到思维转变，即通过学习而发生的深刻生活变化，是任何年龄和任何目标的人都可以实现的。精心制作的MOOC和其他动态学习体验向我们展示了学习是多么强大、有趣，甚至是令人上瘾的。而且，终身学习也能让我们的思维在衰老过程中保持活力。

The second aspect of mind shift relates to career. Career selection, career enhancement, and career switching. We've explored each of these areas and discovered a common theme. That background and training from the past that might at first seem entirely useless often proves valuable in your new job or field. These days, working behind the scenes in the MOOC making world, I'm newly inspired by all the changes that learners are making. Over and over, I see that people have the desire and ability to learn and change at every age and stage. Not only from the humanities to engineering as I did, but in virtually any direction. That's why we've also stressed that a really meaningful mindshift often isn't just about following your passions, but about broadening your passions. Reenvisioning yourself and the directions you can take, both in your private life and in your career, and then taking the steps as a learner to make this revisioning a reality. Since you've taken this MOOC, you undoubtedly have a thirst for knowledge. So I'm hoping that what you've learned here has widened the scope of what you thought you could do, and will help you broaden your passion for discovery. Learning can be an overwhelming pursuit. But it also provides a way for us to meet some of our deepest needs to live as full, vibrant human beings.
思维转变的第二个方面与职业有关，包括职业选择、职业提升和职业转换。我们探讨了这些领域，并发现了一个共同主题：过去的背景和培训，起初看似毫无用处，往往在新的工作或领域中显得非常宝贵。如今，在MOOC制作的幕后工作中，我被学习者所做出的各种变化所激励。我反复看到，人们在每个年龄和阶段都有学习和改变的渴望和能力。不仅是从人文学科转向工程学，几乎可以朝任何方向发展。这就是为什么我们还强调，真正有意义的思维转变并不仅仅是追随你的热情，而是扩展你的热情。重新构想自己和可以采取的方向，无论是在私人生活还是职业上，然后作为学习者采取行动，使这种重新构想成为现实。既然你参加了这个MOOC，你无疑渴望知识。因此，我希望你在这里学到的东西能拓宽你对自己能力的想象，并帮助你扩大对发现的热情。学习可能是一项令人感到压倒性的追求，但它也为我们提供了一种满足我们作为完整、充满活力的人类生活的一些深层需求的方式。

It's been wonderful working with you as you've explored how to make your own mindshift. And I wish you all the best as you put this into action. But, of course, many people rebel against learning or resign themselves to staying where they are in life. What about people like these, you might ask? How can they make a mindshift of the sort we've been talking about? If we can leave you with one last message in this MOOC, it is this. Sometimes it takes just that one special person, a mentor, to unlock or reframe and reveal the unseen potential.
与您一起探索如何实现思维转变真是太好了。我祝愿您在实践中一切顺利。当然，许多人可能会反对学习，或自甘堕落于现状。您可能会问，像这样的人该怎么办？他们如何才能实现我们所讨论的那种思维转变？如果我们能在这个MOOC中给您留下一个最后的信息，那就是：有时，只需要一个特殊的人，一个导师，来解锁、重新框架并揭示潜在的可能性。

And so, we hope this MOOC also inspires you to turn to others. To seek out mentors and also to be a mentor yourself for those who may have lost the passion for discovery. May your own discoveries open the minds of those you touch, so they too, can discover the joy and beauty of learning.
因此，我们希望这个MOOC也能激励您转向他人。去寻找导师，同时也成为那些可能失去探索激情的人的导师。愿您自己的发现能够开启您所接触的人的心灵，让他们也能发现学习的乐趣和美好。



### Optional Bonus Video: Nelson Dellis Memory Tips #5 Language Learning

What's up everyone? Here is another episode of Random Memory Tips. And in this episode, I'm going to teach you how to remember language vocabulary.
大家好！欢迎收看另一个《随机记忆技巧》的节目。在这一集中，我将教你如何记住语言词汇。

How is everyone doing? So last weekend I got the privilege of speaking at Silicon Valley Comic Con. This one had a focus on tech. So there was the comic side of things which was fun and entertaining to watch everybody dressing up. And then the other part of it was tech related which pulled in different companies a lot in the space and science realm. So I go to meet a lot of these people. I got to meet Buzz Aldrin, Adam Savage from Mythbusters. But probably the best discussion I had was this woman that I spoke to who was the inspiration for Amy Adams' character in the movie Arrival. If you haven't seen it, go check it out. Very cool movie about aliens arriving. Amy Adams plays a linguist, someone who studies languages. This scientist was at the Comic Con, and I got the opportunity to speak with her. And we got to talking about languages and it reminded me of one of the common questions I get is, can you speak multiple languages?  The answer is yes, I speak French fluently and English, and a little bit of Spanish, enough to get by. But I wouldn't say that I'm a polyglot or anyone who just absorbs languages. And in fact, to learn a language is a hard thing, it's not just memory. People ask me, can you memorize a language? And yes, I could memorize a lot of vocabulary very quickly, which you need to have in order to speak a language. But I'd still need to practice to learn the vocab. It's not so simple as just memorizing. The nice thing about memorizing foreign language words is you don't need a memory palace. It's all about linking. So what do I mean by linking?  There's the memory palace technique which I've talked about in past videos, go check them out if you haven't, then there's this kind of like technique that's not as powerful as the memory palace method. It has certain strength set only the linking method has and I'll go over linking method for long lists in another video. The basics of this linking method is taking one image and linking it another image. A foreign word and its English translation. Foreign word, English word, boom.  Basically imagine the one thing, whatever it sounds like, whatever it reminds you of, some picture for it. Come up with a picture for the second thing and imagine them interacting together. That's linking, taking these two images and smashing them together. So when I was talking to this, Amy Adams character, I brought up something that I've always thought was kind of interesting. And that is that, to the best of my knowledge, the word butterfly  is unique in every language. At least almost all of them. I'm going to teach you ten different ways to say the word butterfly. The point is to take ten different examples, see how I would go about turning it into a picture and linking them together so that you can take those examples and apply them to whatever language that you want. Okay, nice. All right so you know the first one that's butterfly in English. Number two we're going to talk about French and the word for that is papillon. The sound is papillon. I think of a puppy on something, puppy on something, so our left hand image, the English image for butterfly is going to be the actual butterfly, okay. And then the foreign language is going to be the thing we ad lib, in this case we have a puppy on. Then we're going to mash them together right? So I'm going to picture a puppy on top of a butterfly, okay. To remember that this was the French language. Papillon, puppy on. What we should do is add some element of French. What's something French that you think of? So puppy on a butterfly, maybe give this puppy a little mustache, a little beret and a striped shirt.
大家好！欢迎收看《随机记忆技巧》的另一集。在这一集中，我将教你如何记住语言词汇。

最近我有幸在硅谷动漫展上发言，这次活动着重于科技部分。在这里，我见到了许多公司和科学领域的人士，包括巴兹·奥尔德林和《神秘博士》的亚当·萨维奇。但最有趣的讨论是与一位女性的交流，她是电影《降临》中艾米·亚当斯角色的灵感来源。电影讲述了外星人到来的故事，艾米·亚当斯扮演一位语言学家。

关于语言，很多人问我是否会说多种语言。我可以流利地说法语和英语，还有一点西班牙语，但我并不认为自己是一个会吸收语言的多语者。学习一门语言并不简单，仅仅靠记忆是不够的。尽管我能很快记住大量词汇，但仍需要练习才能真正掌握。

记住外语单词时不需要记忆宫殿，而是要运用链接技巧。链接技巧是将一个图像与另一个图像联系在一起，比如外语单词和其英语翻译。我们来看看“蝴蝶”这个词在十种不同语言中的表达方式，看看如何将这些例子转化为图像并相互链接。

第一个是英语中的“butterfly”。第二个是法语，叫做“papillon”。我将“papillon”想象成一只在某物上面的“小狗”，然后将这个图像与“蝴蝶”结合起来，想象一只小狗在蝴蝶上。为了更好地记住法语的“papillon”，可以为小狗加上一些法式元素，比如小胡子、贝雷帽和条纹衫。这样就形成了一个有趣的图像，有助于记忆！

Puppy on a butterfly. But let's move on to the next word. We're going to have a say butterfly in Spanish. The word for that is mariposa. So the image for that is going to be marry pose, so you're getting married and this is the pose you take, whatever ridiculous pose you want to imagine. You're there at the end of the aisle, about to get married, and you strike a pose with a beautiful butterfly on your finger. So it's your married pose. To help you remember that in Spanish, just imagine this wedding decoration, this bull fighter outfits, and there's these Spanish flags draped everywhere. Tapas is being served at this wedding and you're doing your married pose with that butterfly, okay? That's our third one. All right, next one's a good one. It's Italian.  The way to say butterfly in Italian is farfalla. Which, if you're familiar with pastas, farfalla is the one that looks like a butterfly. If you've never had that pasta before then let's come up with image the way it kind reads it looks like far fall someone is falling very far. Italy is known for its beautiful coastlines is often of a cliff they build these beautiful villages of course we going to tie it back to a butterflies some how so maybe you think your butterfly. And you jump off this cliff, this beautiful Italian coastline cliff and it's a far fall and you plummet into the ocean.  Okay Dutch. Here's how to say butterfly in Dutch. It's vlinder. It kind of sounds like blender so I'm going to picture putting a butterfly in a blender. Maybe a ton of butterflies in a blender and it just makes this smoothie of butterflies. Let's tie it back to dutch windmills, right? They're famous windmills. So maybe the blender is just a big windmill, right, with a cup on top of it. And that's where you're putting in the butterflies, it just spins like it normally does, and you have this blender, blender, vlender, vwender, blender of butterflies. This is my favorite one just because all the other one's sound very beautiful or short and kind of cute. German of course is pretty harsh, but it's a good one. It's fun to say. And the word for butterfly in German is, schmetterling. I don't know if I'm saying that correct, but schmetterling. Here's where sometimes you have to take liberties with the image for the word. It doesn't always have to be exactly close to it. So I'm going to go with, an hear me out, butter. I'm going to imagine schmearing butter, right? That helps me get that kind of schma sound. So I have this schmeared butter, schmutter. Maybe let's imagine there are sausage links. Specifically bratwurst or some really serious German sausage right? So, this butterfly is shmearing butter all over these links and they're German sausages. Portuguese, borboleta. I could imagine there's a barb wire fence, and someone is letting me through it. So barb o let. Barb wire let. Who's letting me in? Of course, it's a nice big butterfly who's standing guard. And we have to tie that back to Portuguese somehow, I think of Brazil. It's just sambaing, when he lets you through the barbed wire. Next is Danish. The word for butterfly in Danish is sommerfugl. And what it makes me think of is a summer, summertime. I think of the Bugle chips that you put on your fingers, the little cone-shaped things, and you eat them off, right? You're in the grass, sun is out, it's a beautiful summer day. And maybe a butterfly comes and eats each one off your finger. Maybe the butterfly lands on your hand and then asks you, hey I don't eat bugles, do you have any danishes? Nom. That way you can tie it back to it being from Denmark, Danish. Okay, so, Finnish, perhonen. The picture I think of a pear, the fruit, it's honing in on something. This pear is honing in on a butterfly, we have to tie this to Finland or Finnish somehow, so, maybe, this pear is honing in on that butterfly to finish him. Maybe you can hear that mortal combat sound. Finish him. Finish him. Finally it is Russian and the way to say that is babochka. Babe, says ouch, he's being pricked or something. He's at the doctor and then he goes, I'm okay. Babe ouch kay, is not quite right. But if you keep those syllables in your mind, you can probably get the word babochka, close enough. A butterfly comes and maybe that's who administers the prick. A little pinch, maybe they're drawing blood or giving a vaccine, this butterfly does it. And the babe goes ouch, and then he's like kay, not a big deal. For the word Russia think of rushing, something rushed, right. So maybe this is a really rushed visual, right. So this babe suddenly get pricked by a butterfly, ouch, kay really rushed. All right, that's all ten languages. How to say butterfly. I'm going to take 30 seconds to distract your brain. And then we'll come back and see if you can remember them. I'm going to show you some highlights of my trip to Silicon Valley Comic Con. It's pretty interesting. Here we go. We'll come back and I'll test you.
让我们继续下一个单词。在西班牙语中，“蝴蝶”是“mariposa”。为了记住这个词，我会想象“marry pose”，即结婚时的姿势。想象一下你在婚礼上，摆出一个姿势，手指上停着一只美丽的蝴蝶，周围是婚礼装饰、斗牛士服装和悬挂的西班牙国旗，现场还在供应小吃。这样就能帮助你记住这个西班牙词汇。

接下来是意大利语，蝴蝶在意大利语中叫做“farfalla”。如果你熟悉意大利面，farfalla就是看起来像蝴蝶的那种面。想象一下有人从悬崖上跳下去，正好是“far fall”。意大利以美丽的海岸线而闻名，所以可以想象这只蝴蝶从悬崖上飞下来，优雅地落入海洋。

在荷兰语中，蝴蝶是“vlinder”。这个词听起来像“blender”，我想象把蝴蝶放进搅拌机。可以想象很多蝴蝶在搅拌机里，变成蝴蝶奶昔。然后把这个搅拌机想象成荷兰著名的风车，风车的顶部放着一个杯子，里面装着蝴蝶。

接下来是德语，蝴蝶叫做“schmetterling”。这个词听起来很有趣，尽管有点难发音。为了帮助记忆，我想象在涂抹黄油（“schmearing butter”），而这只蝴蝶正在把黄油涂在德国香肠上。

在葡萄牙语中，蝴蝶是“borboleta”。我想象着一个铁丝网，有人把我放进来（“barb wire let”），那只蝴蝶就像在守卫，欢迎我过去。联想到巴西，想象着它在跳桑巴舞。

丹麦语中蝴蝶是“sommerfugl”。我会想象一个夏天的场景，穿着小号喇叭饼干（Bugle chips）的人，蝴蝶在阳光明媚的夏天吃掉每一个喇叭饼干。

芬兰语中是“perhonen”。我会想象一个梨正在聚焦于一只蝴蝶，梨的名字暗示了“finish him”的感觉，像是在进行一场格斗游戏。

最后是俄语，蝴蝶是“babochka”。想象一个人被针扎到（“ouch”），然后说“没事，kay”。这只蝴蝶就是负责给他打针的。

好，现在我们已经介绍完十种语言中的“蝴蝶”了。接下来我会给你30秒的时间来放松一下大脑，之后再来测试你记住的内容。顺便给你看看我在硅谷动漫展上的一些精彩瞬间！

All right so here we go. English butterfly obviously. French papillon. Spanish mariposa. Italian farfalla. Dutch, vlinder. German, schmetterling. Portuguese, borboleta.  Danish, sommerfugal.  Finnish perhonen and Russian babochka. Anyways, I hope this helps a little bit. I'm sure in future videos we'll talk more about learning vocab for languages, but this one was just to give you a little taste of how to do it with a simple word in different languages. And to teach you the basics of the linking method. Take one item, link it to the next. Like this video, subscribe, leave comments if you have any questions or suggestions for future videos. I'll be back with another random memory tip video in no time. I'm out!
好了，来总结一下。英语中的“蝴蝶”是“butterfly”，法语是“papillon”，西班牙语是“mariposa”，意大利语是“farfalla”，荷兰语是“vlinder”，德语是“schmetterling”，葡萄牙语是“borboleta”，丹麦语是“sommerfugl”，芬兰语是“perhonen”，俄语是“babochka”。希望这些信息对你有所帮助。我相信在未来的视频中，我们会更多地讨论学习语言词汇的方法，但这期视频只是为了让你了解如何用不同语言处理一个简单的单词，并教你链接方法的基础：将一个物品链接到下一个物品。

### Memory Tips: Nelson Dellis on How to Memorize a Speech or a Script

Hello and welcome to another episode of Random Memory Tips. And in this episode, we are going to talk about something that I get asked about all the time. How do I memorize text? To be honest it's hard. It's very hard. Why? Because there are so many little words and on top of that, you have to say it, deliver it with intention and fluidity and all these things. Make it seem like it's naturally coming out of you. That you don't have to think about it and try to access information.
你好，欢迎来到另一集《随机记忆技巧》。在这一集中，我们将讨论一个我经常被问到的问题：我该如何记忆文本？说实话，这很难，因为有很多小词。此外，你还必须用意图和流畅性来表达，让它看起来像是自然流露的，而不是费力地获取信息。

I was in Boston this past weekend. Go all historical. And I thought about the Declaration of Independence. I thought it'd be a great piece of text that we could practice together to show how I would go about memorizing something like that. So you can apply this to your speeches. You can apply this to learning lines. You can apply this to just memorizing some passage or quote or whatever you want. And so without further ado, here we go.
我这个周末去了波士顿，感受了一下历史氛围。我想到了《独立宣言》，觉得这是一个很好的文本，适合我们一起练习，展示我如何记忆这样的内容。你可以将这种方法应用到演讲中、学习台词中，或是记忆某些段落或引用。好了，废话不多说，我们开始吧。

I have the first paragraph of the Declaration of Independence in front of me. Do you read through it a few times just to kind of get the gist? And it's okay if you don't memorize it at that point. The next step is to use that memory palace. Again, I'm using that memory palace. It is a go to thing to use when you have to memorize something. And memorizing text is no different. Among memory athletes, a lot of us kind of battle back and forth. What's the right way to approach memorizing texts? Is it one, memorize every single word by putting them all in memory palaces or memorize the general phrasing of a poem or text and place those ideas into a memory palace and then rehearse it enough so that you know the filler words?
我面前有《独立宣言》的第一段。首先，你可以先读几遍，了解大意。如果这时还没有记住也没关系。接下来是使用记忆宫殿的方法。我会再次使用这个方法，因为它是记忆任何内容时的首选。记忆文本也不例外。在记忆运动员中，我们常常讨论，记忆文本的正确方法是什么？是逐字记忆，把每个单词都放进记忆宫殿，还是记住文本或诗歌的大致表述，将这些想法放进记忆宫殿，然后通过重复练习来掌握填充词？

On one hand, this will guarantee that you get everything because your putting everything in your memory palace. Whereas this one is more the idea and then you get to use that repetition rehearsal to fill in the words. The memory part is a lot easier. I believe that if your goal is to get something across, very fluent and natural, then this option is the way to go. Because you're going to have the ideas in your head and the rest will be rehearsed. You can use your memory palace as a guide to help you through what you memorize but the other something is super internalized.
一方面，这种方法可以确保你记住所有内容，因为你将所有信息都放入记忆宫殿。而另一种方法更注重于概念，然后通过重复练习来填充具体的单词。记忆的部分要简单得多。我相信，如果你的目标是流畅自然地表达内容，那么这种方法是更好的选择。因为你会在脑中掌握概念，其他部分则通过排练来记忆。你可以使用记忆宫殿作为指南，帮助你回忆起所记忆的内容，但另一个部分则是非常内化的。

All right, so I've broken up that first paragraph into 11 different phrases. They vary in size and length and complexity. I split up where it felt right. With a poem, this would be easier because there's going to be a certain beat to it. With text, maybe if the sentence is short enough, that's your phrase. If it's like a conjunction, you can stop 'til the end and or whatever feels right. Each of those phrases are going to be turned into a picture or a series of pictures that we put in our memory palace. Like we've done before.
好的，我把第一段分成了11个不同的短语。它们在大小、长度和复杂性上各不相同。我在感觉合适的地方进行了划分。对于诗歌来说，这会更容易，因为会有一定的节奏感。而对于文本，如果句子足够短，那就是你的短语。如果是连词之类的，可以停在句子的末尾，或者根据感觉来调整。每个短语都会变成一个图像或一系列图像，然后我们把它们放入我们的记忆宫殿，就像之前做的那样。

To do this with you, I want to choose a memory palace that we can do together. What I was thinking is we could use a map or journey through the United States using the more familiar cities as the locations for our memory palace. So children, 11 cities around the country and since I'm from Miami, will start in Miami. That will be our first location. And so, what we'll do is we'll kind of make our way up the East Coast, across the country and to the west coast. It's easy to remember that. Each city, we'll kind of choose something that reminds us of that city to find it anchored. So we'll be in Miami. Next could be Washington D.C. then Philadelphia, New York City, Boston, Buffalo, which is where Niagara Falls is, it's the middle of the country, then Chicago, Denver, Las Vegas, L.A. and if we go up little bit, we have San Francisco. Got it?
为了和大家一起做这个，我想选择一个记忆宫殿，我们可以使用美国地图或旅程，通过熟悉的城市作为我们的记忆宫殿的位置。所以，我们将选择全国11个城市，既然我来自迈阿密，我们就从迈阿密开始。这将是我们的第一个位置。然后，我们会一路向上，经过东海岸，穿过国家到达西海岸，这样更容易记住。每个城市，我们都会选择一些让我们想起该城市的东西来作为锚定。

所以，我们会在迈阿密，接下来是华盛顿特区，然后是费城，纽约市，波士顿，布法罗（那里有尼亚加拉大瀑布），接着是芝加哥，丹佛，拉斯维加斯，洛杉矶，最后我们再往上走一点，就是旧金山。明白了吗？

So we're starting in Miami and we have our first little segment which is going to be when in the course of human events. Now remember, I'm not doing it word for word. That's going to be a different approach. I'm trying to go for the one that's quicker and I think this is the quickest. When I look at that sentence, I got to choose kind of the key words, key features, and in my head, I see course of human events.
所以我们从迈阿密开始，我们的第一个小段落是“当在人类事件的过程中”。请记住，我不是逐字记忆。这将是另一种方法。我试图用更快的方式，我认为这是最快的。当我看着这个句子时，我需要选择一些关键词和关键特征，在我脑海中，我看到“人类事件的过程”。

So, I kind of string those words into a little image and I'm going to attach it to Miami. When I think of course, I think of like a boat on its course. You can imagine a boat is on a course arriving at Miami Beach and there's a lot of human events going on right there. Maybe a lot of those events are very bizarre and of a particular taste. There's a course to all of these human events. Boom. That's it. That's the first one. We got it.
所以，我把这些词串成一个小图像，然后把它与迈阿密关联起来。当我想到“过程”时，我想到的是一艘船在航行。你可以想象这艘船正驶向迈阿密海滩，那里发生着许多人类事件。也许这些事件中有很多都很奇特，颇具特色。这些人类事件都有其特定的过程。完成了。这就是第一个。我们搞定了！

When you're trying to remember this, you're going to say, okay, that's our Miami beach course human events. Of course you're not going to say course human events because that's not line. But, once we finish this step, you're going to start filling in the words.
当你试图记住这个时，你会想，“好，这是我们的迈阿密海滩过程人类事件。”当然，你不会说“过程人类事件”，因为那不是整句。但一旦我们完成这一步，你就可以开始填充具体的词汇了。

So then, all you have to add to that is when in the and of. All right. Let's move on. Next up, we are moving to Washington D.C. Okay. My picture for that was the Declaration of Independence. So the next phrase is it becomes necessary for one people. So I can picture one person and I'm just going to imagine that it becomes necessary for that one person to have this done. Like he's breaking in to this museum where the Declaration of Independence is. Just overcome by how necessary it is for this one person to have this done 'til becomes necessary. Next stop, we're moving up to Philly. Philadelphia. And we have a bell, right? That's what that city is famous for.
所以接下来，你只需要加上“当在”和“的”。好的。接下来，我们要去华盛顿特区。我的画面是《独立宣言》。下一个短语是“对一个人民来说是必要的”。我可以想象一个人，我只想象这个人有多么必要去完成这件事——他正在闯入一个存放《独立宣言》的博物馆。接下来，我们要去费城。费城以钟声著称，对吧？

The next line we have is 'to dissolve the political bands'. Dissolve and bands, political bands. So those are kind of the three words that I'm going to put together. So, I can imagine political band. If I take those two words and just literally picture a band, like a headband or an arm band that's very political. Maybe it has the person you voted for. Let's say, if I put it on this bell, it dissolves. Picture that, dissolving political bands. So after that, we move up to Central Park, New York City. That's our next location. For the next phrase is 'which have connected them with another'. I'm in Central Park, that's my location and there's a witch which is that first word of the phrase. Connected with another. So I'm going to picture this witch running around Central Park connecting them. Let's just imagine that them is kind of old people in the park. So, I'm going to picture this witch going up to people and connecting them. Maybe, she literally creates some sticky glue that connects them all together.
下一个短语是“解除政治关系”。解除和关系，政治关系。这是我将要结合的三个词。我可以想象一个政治头带。如果我把这两个词字面上看，就会想到一个头带或臂带，上面有你投票的人的名字。如果我把它放在这个钟上，它就会 dissolves。想象一下，解除政治关系。

接下来，我们来到中央公园，纽约市。下一个短语是“将他们与另一个连接”。我的位置是中央公园，那里有一个女巫，这就是这个短语的第一个词。连接另一个。所以，我想象这个女巫在中央公园里跑来跑去，把他们连接起来。我们可以想象“他们”是公园里的一些老人。所以，我想象这个女巫走到这些人身边，用一些粘性胶水将他们连接在一起。

After New York, we go up to Boston. That's the next city up. And our picture from Boston was Harvard which has a beautiful campus and a very good story. The next line is 'and to assume among the powers of the earth'. Powers of the earth. That's kind of a nice little chunk, I can picture that and assume. I'm going to say assume even among your work, you might want to include that. Assume among the powers of the earth. When I hear the word assume, I think of a big ass. And then, among kind of sounds like a monk. So, I'm going to picture an ass on top of a monk. As this ass touches the monk, he suddenly has all the powers of the Earth. Earth around and vibrates and suddenly powerful because of this ass touching this monk. We have to tie this to Boston somehow. We're using Harvard. So, imagine this monk is studying at Harvard. Somewhere on campus, you can picture a generic university and ass touches this monk and yes.
接下来，我们去波士顿，那里有哈佛大学，美丽的校园和很好的故事。下一句是“在地球的力量之中假定”。地球的力量。这是一段很好的短语，我可以想象它。假定。当我听到“假定”这个词时，我想到一个大屁股（ass）。然后，“之中”有点像一个僧侣（monk）。所以，我想象一个屁股放在一个僧侣的身上。当这个屁股碰到僧侣时，他突然获得了所有地球的力量。周围的地球震动，因这个屁股的触碰而变得强大。我们要把这一切与波士顿联系起来，用哈佛大学。想象这个僧侣在哈佛学习，某个地方的校园里，你可以想象一个普通的大学，这个屁股碰到这个僧侣，没错。

All right, we're getting there. The next one is Buffalo, which was the Niagara Falls, the famous waterfall on the border of US and Canada. And our next line is the 'separate and equal station'. I'm going to think of separate and equal and a station. So I'll think like a train station. Imagine, next to this waterfall, separate to this waterfall but equal, right? They're both equally regarded as interesting things to see, right? You have this massive waterfall and you have this separate but equally cool train station. Okay?
接下来，我们在布法罗，想象尼亚加拉大瀑布旁边有一个火车站。这个火车站与瀑布是分开的，但它们同样引人注目。可以想象这个火车站的设计和瀑布形成鲜明对比，吸引游客。这样，“separate and equal station”就和布法罗的景点联系在一起了。

And maybe that transition goes right over the cliff just like this waterfall. It's separate, but it's equally interesting and it's a station. Next up, we move west in our little mental map of the United States. And when in Chicago, I think of pizza, right? Or maybe, deep dish Chicago pizza. That's going to be my anchor for the city of Chicago. And the line I have to remember is 'to which the laws of nature'. Again, I have the word which, and two which so I might think of two witches.
接下来，我们在芝加哥。想象一下，深盘比萨在桌子上，旁边有两个女巫。她们正在讨论“自然法则”，可以想象她们用比萨的配料来代表这些法律。也许她们用比萨上的香肠和奶酪创造出自然法则的形象，这样就能把这个短语与芝加哥的比萨关联起来。

Let's imagine them inside a pizzeria. These two witches, sitting across from each other. And they are bending the laws of nature to create the most amazing pizza in front of them. And they're just scarfing it down. They love pizza, they're having a chat, banter back and forth, that witches do. To which the laws of nature. We're getting to the end. Here we'll give them, keep going west to Denver where our picture was a mountain because Denver is known as the Mile High City. It's near the Rockies, so mountain. The next line is 'and of nature's God entitle them'.
在丹佛的这幅画面中，想象这两个女巫正在一座高高的山上，享受着她们的比萨。在山顶上，她们仰望天空，感觉到“nature's God”的存在，仿佛大自然的神赋予了她们某种特权。她们在山顶庆祝，感觉自己被赋予了“entitle them”的权利，仿佛她们的创作不仅仅是比萨，而是得到了神灵的认可。这将“and of nature's God entitle them”与丹佛的高山结合起来。

In this one, nature's God and entitle them really are what stick out. The picture on top of this mountain is nature's God. Not just God, but nature's God. So maybe, to make the difference, imagine that nature's God is just like covered in grass and twigs and very treelike. And he's giving titles to everyone, them. Nature's God, top of the mountain, above everyone, handing out titles to everyone, to them. Now we move on to Las Vegas, bright lights, casinos, the strip, everything. And our phrase here is 'a decent respect to the opinions of mankind'. I'm going to remember decent respect and opinions of mankind.
在拉斯维加斯的场景中，想象着五光十色的霓虹灯和熙熙攘攘的人群。为了记住“a decent respect to the opinions of mankind”，我会想象一个穿着礼服的人站在赌场的中心，优雅地向周围的人们鞠躬，以表达对他们意见的尊重。这个人手里还拿着一张牌，上面写着“Decent Respect”。在这个璀璨的背景下，其他人都在兴奋地玩游戏，而他则专注于向他们表达尊重。这样，拉斯维加斯的繁华和“decent respect to the opinions of mankind”就紧密结合在一起。

You know, we're in Vegas, we're in Sin City. So, imagine you're in casino. People are just drinking and gambling. People that are dressed to the nines. Some are very inappropriate. Whatever, it's Vegas, right? You walk into this casino. You try to give a decent respect to everyone. You're not judging anyone, everything happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. So you have a decent amount of respect to people. Not complete respect, a decent amount. Just enough because you're there too, after all. And you're just thinking to yourself as you have this decent respect of the opinions of mankind. You're thinking of all the different opinions that mankind would have on what you're seeing in this casino. So we have a decent respect and about these opinions of mankind in the casino. We're in the last two.
接下来，我们来到洛杉矶，阳光明媚，明星璀璨。我们的短语是“to declare the causes which impel them to the separation”。在这个场景中，我想象自己在好莱坞的星光大道上，看到一位明星站在红地毯上，正准备宣布他们的分离原因。想象这位明星高举麦克风，面对众多媒体，表情严肃地说出“to declare the causes”。这位明星在璀璨的灯光下，身后是闪光的相机，聚焦在他们的每一个字上，暗示着这场分离的重要性。最后，我们的终点是旧金山，金门大桥是我们的标志。短语是“and to the people of the United States”。在这座桥上，我想象一群人站在桥边，举起国旗，象征着对美国人民的承诺。这个场景将所有的地点和短语串联在一起，让整个记忆宫殿生动而具体。

Now we move to L.A. or the West Coast. L.A., I think of like these really tall palm trees that they have in L.A.. Think of Beverly Hills and our line here is 'requires that they should declare'. You're going down Beverly Hills with all these fancy houses, you're seeing celebrities, there's palm trees. You also see a lot of people from other places. Who are all these people? They should require that they should declare, like you do at the airport. You have something declare or not? On this boulevard in Beverly Hills, you're going to require that they, everyone, that they should declare. Maybe declare their intentions or maybe declare what they brought from their other country they came. You're going to require that. You're suddenly the police of that. You require that you should declare.
最后，我们来到旧金山，金门大桥的美景非常吸引人。我们的短语是“and to the people of the United States”。想象自己站在金门大桥上，俯瞰着海湾，桥的两侧有很多人。每个人都举起国旗，象征着对美国人民的承诺和团结。在桥的另一边，有一群人在讨论、交流，象征着与美国人民的连接和合作。这个场景不仅突出了短语的意义，还将所有之前的记忆点串联在一起，让整个记忆宫殿生动而完整。这样，我们就成功地用记忆宫殿法记住了《独立宣言》的第一段内容！

And lastly, we finish up in San Francisco. I think San Francisco, I think Golden Gate Bridge. The line here, the last line of that paragraph is 'the causes which impel them to the separation'. What sticks out there is causes, impel and separation. Let's imagine that the bridge is going to separate. This is very sturdy bridge but suddenly it's just alive and it wants to separate one half from the end. And so we're thinking, as outsiders, we're looking at this bridge and saying what are the causes of this separation? But we want to get the word impel. So when I look at the word impel, I see it imp. Imp instantly reminds me of Tyrion Lannister from Game of Thrones. He's often referred to as the Imp. So why is this bridge separated? The cause is because of this imp. He's making them separate.
所以在旧金山的金门大桥上，我们看到这座桥的两半由于这个小精灵（Imp）而分开。我们想象这个小精灵在桥上跳来跳去，导致桥的两个部分逐渐分离。这个场景不仅让我们记住“causes”，“impel”和“separation”，还生动地展示了这个短语的意图。

通过这种方式，我们完成了整个记忆旅程！现在，当你回想起每个城市和相应的短语时，这些图像会帮助你轻松地回忆起《独立宣言》的第一段内容。只需沿着这条心中的路线走一遍，就能流畅地复述出这些重要的短语。记住，关键在于将这些图像与每个城市的特征结合起来，这样它们会牢牢地留在你的记忆中。

Okay. So we've done 11 lines. I'm actually trying go through it myself and you can try it along with me. Course human events becomes necessary for one people. Dissolves political bands. Which connected them with another. Assume among the powers the earth. A separate and equal station to which the laws of nature. Nature's God entitled them. A decent respect for the opinions of mankind. Something like that. Requires that they should declare. Causes which impel them to the separation. There you have it. That was pretty good actually. Okay, so now you have them in your mind. What you have to do now is slowly add the pieces back. And this is where you study those filler words. Some of those lines, we have perfect. Some of them we have, maybe, 50 percent and some where we have in between that, right? What's nice is now I can look at it with this text map out of my mind with this memory palace. And remember we use the United States as memory palace. You can use your house, you can use a video game, a movie, whatever you want. Any place you know well that you can navigate through. You can store those images on locations through that journey. That's it, we just memorize first paragraph of the Declaration of Independence. If you want to get really good at it, you just got to rehearse in your head. You get those filler words. It might take another 10 minutes. That's it for today. Please subscribe, like, share and I'll be back with another video very soon. Thanks for watching. Love you, guys. I'm out.
