WHAT ARE CCHUNKS: 
  - compact packages of information that human's mind can easily access.
  - HELPS `unite` bits of information together through `meaning`.
  - the path to expertise is built little by little, small chunks can become larger. and all of the expertise serves to underpin more creative interpretations as you gradually become a master of the material.
