**Goal**: To rapidly build foundational knowledge in a completely unfamiliar discipline, progressing from broad understanding to deep expertise, while eliminating barriers caused by information asymmetry.

## Big Picture Cycle

**Object**: Quick grasp the fundamental information of discipline and and know your position within it as you study specific knowledge.

`STEP A`: Create a complete **disciplinary learning map**, including all the sub-disciplines and related fields of a given academic subject. 

`STEP B`: For each sub-discipline, list the following meta information: **object of study**, **core questions**, **key concepts**, paradigmatic shifts, applications. 
  - Composing a **brief disciplinary history** that encompasses these questions sometimes can be very meaningful, particularly in the fields of literature and philosophy.

`STEP C`: Check forrunners' suggestions, then list **best online self-learning resources** including textbooks, notes, and online video courses.
  - Fear not that your abilities fall short of elite university courses, for the finest institutions excel at turning complexity into clarity, and difficulty into illumination.
  - When you're unsure where to start, you can refer to existing learning roadmaps, Wikipedia, or ChatGPT for guidance.

`STEP D`: Draw a breif learning order flow chart, showing prerequisites and subsequent study of every discipline.

`STEP E`: Choose 1 discipline to start with the method of [Concrete Memorization Cycle]().

### Example


MATHEMATICS

...

linear Algebra

**Object of Study**: the structure and behavior of `vector spaces` and the `linear transformations` (or mappings) between them.

**Core Questions**:
  1. How to solve and classify systems of linear equations: 



## Concrete Memorization Cycle

**Obejct**: Quickly learn a specific course and commit it to memory for rapid application.

`STEP α`: Pick a task chunk that takes less than 1 hour and dive into it—spend your brainpower on thinking and analyzing, recording only **keywords** in a paper.
  - It's best to finish all trunks within 4 days if possible.

`STEP β`: Recall what you've learned by connecting **keywords**. Use these keywords as anchors to write brief annotations.
  - If the task is not completed, repeat `step α`.

`STEP γ`: Once the entire task is completed, create a tutorial for beginners based on the previously recorded keywords. Be sure to include tacit knowledge and the logical progression of ideas.
  - Try to build a coherent and comprehensive knowledge system within your notes.
  - You can use content from Wikipedia and ChatGPT to improve efficiency. Be sure to verify their accuracy.

`Step δ`: Complete assignments and post-class projects, and identify and correct blind spots or assumptions in your earlier notes. For many disciplines, engaging in practical tasks and experiencing the process firsthand is the most crucial part of learning.

`STEP ε`: Identify and study a small number of seminal papers, high-quality review articles, and recent research in the field.

> At this stage, the focused study of the course is complete. But if new insights arise in future learning, be sure to revisit and update the tutorials accordingly.
