## 1 The Problems of Knowledge

### 1. Cognition

What sets human beings apart from other animals is their capacity for sophisticated thought. Only human beings are capable of the kinds of cognition required to build an airplane or a microwave oven, to write Hamlet or compose a symphony, to propound the Theory of Relativity or discover DNA. We have voluminous knowledge of the world, and most of that knowledge concerns matters other animals cannot even conceive of. How is it that we are able to engage in such sophisticated thought and arrive at the capacious knowledge that we use to direct both our everyday activities and our momentous achievements like flying to the moon or curing cancer? That is the subject matter of epistemology—the theory of knowledge.

人类与其他动物的区别在于其复杂思维能力。只有人类具备建造飞机或微波炉、撰写《哈姆雷特》或作曲交响乐、提出相对论或发现 DNA 所需的认知能力。我们对世界有广泛的知识，而这些知识大多是其他动物无法想象的。我们如何能够进行如此复杂的思维，并获得用于指导日常活动和重大成就（如登月或治愈癌症）的广博知识？这正是知识论——知识理论的研究对象。

What we want is to understand rational thought, from the routine to the sublime. We want to know how it is possible for us to accomplish the epistemic tasks upon whose results we base our lives and which other creatures find so impossible. We want to understand human beings as cognizers.

我们希望理解从日常到崇高的理性思维。我们想知道我们如何完成那些我们以其结果为基础的生活，并且其他生物认为不可能的认知任务。我们希望理解人类作为认知者的特性。

Cognitive psychology investigates certain aspects of human cognition through the methods of science. But our interest here is in specifically rational cognition. Psychologists study human thought when it goes wrong as well as when it goes right, but we want to know what it is for it to go right. What is it that makes human beings rational, and thereby makes our enormous intellectual achievements possible? The psychologist, in studying both rational and irrational thought, presupposes a pre-theoretic understanding of rationality, but does little to illuminate it. While we may marvel at the cognitive psychologist’s use of sophisticated experiments to determine how human beings think, what it means to think rationally is a philosophical challenge. What we want is a general theory of rationality—what is it to be a rational cognizer, and how does being rational make it possible for us to acquire the wide variety of world knowledge that we take almost for granted? This is a philosophical question with a long and rich history.

认知心理学通过科学方法研究人类认知的某些方面。但我们感兴趣的是具体的理性认知。心理学家研究人类思维的正确与错误，但我们想知道什么是正确的。是什么使人类成为理性的，并因此使我们能够实现巨大的智力成就？心理学家在研究理性和非理性思维时，预设了一种理论前的理性理解，但很少阐明这一点。尽管我们可能对认知心理学家使用复杂实验来确定人类思维方式感到惊奇，但理性思维的意义是一个哲学挑战。我们希望得到一个关于理性的普遍理论——作为一个理性认知者意味着什么，以及理性如何使我们能够获得我们几乎视为理所当然的广泛世界知识？这是一个具有悠久而丰富历史的哲学问题。

Rational cognition includes more than the pursuit of knowledge. Knowledge has a purpose. It is to help us get around in the world. We use our knowledge to guide us in deciding how to act, and rational cognition includes the cognitive processes involved in action decisions. This book, however, will focus on the purely intellectual aspects of cognition that are involved in the pursuit of knowledge.


理性认知不仅仅是追求知识。知识是有目的的。它帮助我们在世界中行事。我们用知识来指导我们的行动决策，而理性认知包括参与行动决策的认知过程。然而，本书将专注于与知识追求相关的纯粹智力方面的认知。

One of the remarkable conclusions of contemporary epistemology is that the rational thought responsible for our great intellectual achievements is not different in kind from the rational thought involved in routine epistemic procedures, like determining the color of an object seen in broad daylight, remembering your mother’s name, discovering that most objects fall to the ground when unsupported, or summing 12 and 25. If we can understand how rational thought enables us to solve these routine epistemic problems, we can understand the discovery of DNA as the result of stringing together a large number of routine problems. What is extraordinary about human thought is already present in our ability to solve routine epistemic problems. Thus we begin by focusing on the mundane, in hopes that it will lead us to the sublime.

当代知识论的一个显著结论是，负责我们伟大智力成就的理性思维与参与常规认知程序（如在日光下确定物体的颜色、记住你母亲的名字、发现大多数物体在无支撑时会掉到地上或计算 12 和 25 的和）的理性思维在本质上并无不同。如果我们能理解理性思维如何使我们解决这些常规的认知问题，我们就能理解发现 DNA 是通过串联大量常规问题的结果。人类思维的非凡之处在于我们解决常规认知问题的能力。因此，我们从关注平凡开始，希望它能引领我们走向崇高。
