**Explanation:**
1. Historical stage of western philosophy is partitioned by paradigm shift.

## Mythos to Logos (c. 6c BCE)

**Core Problems:**

**Paradigm Shift:** Transition from mythos (genealogical, theogonic narrative) to logos (impersonal causal explanation).

**Features:**
  - **Naturalistic** - its attention is directed to nature.
  - Mostly **Hylozoistic** (Hylozoism) - it conceives nature as animated or alive.
  - **Ontological** - it inquires into the essence of things.
  - Mainly **Monistic** - it seeks to explain its phenomena by means of a single principle.
  - **Dogmatic** - it naïvely presupposes the competence of the human mind to solve the world-problem.

**Two interdependent problem about REALITY:** 
  - What is the basic`substance`, its constitution and origination.
  - How the basic substances `changes` into the familiar *object of sense*.

> *Object of sense*: the sensory experiences derived from the five senses: sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch.

**Figures:** 
  - Thales is usually named the inaugurator of `natural philosophy`.
