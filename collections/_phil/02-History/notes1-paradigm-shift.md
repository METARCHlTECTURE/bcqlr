## 西方哲学的进步历程？

`自然哲学`——从神话开始，试图解释自然，但缺乏反思、陷入独断论。
   1. `泰勒斯`首先突破神话宇宙论，尝试使用自然物质本身**解释世界**。
   2. `阿那克西曼德`否定有界者，首次抽象出了**形而上**的维度。
   3. `毕达哥拉斯`以数提出“**形式**”这一哲学概念。
   4. `赫拉克利特`认为万物互相转化，但**转化的规则是不变的**。
   5. `巴门尼德`提出万物共性是“**存在**”，成为形而上学的基础。真理和意见、存在和现象、思想和感觉互相对应。开始了哲学的推理论证。
   6. `芝诺`更近一步认为**思想**比感觉更重要。
   7. `麦里梭`提出了永恒概念。
   8. `恩培多克勒`调和了以上观点，认为变化物质世界是由永恒不变的微粒构成。两种力推动微粒组合与分离，是万物生灭变化的本质。
   9. `阿那克萨戈拉`提出了心灵概念，明确提出了物质和精神的二分，把抽象的原则引入了事物的本质之中。
   10. `留基波`和`德谟克利特`提出了“原子论”，认为世界是虚空和虚空中运动的原子构成。并进一步探索了人类如何拥有感觉的问题，并提出了伦理学问题。

`第一次转向`——关注人类自身和生活，为知识辩护——`伦理学`、`认识论`、`形而上学`
   1. 智者派和`苏格拉底`认为哲学应该研究正义、美德、勇敢、虔敬等与人类有关的问题，而不是深邃玄奥的自然。
   2. `普罗泰戈拉`认为人类的认识是相对的，受限于其能力和知觉，永远无法到达真理。（相对主义、怀疑主义）

中世纪哲学——提出数个哲学的重要议题

近代哲学的开端——`唯理论`、`经验论`及其结合
   1. 此时期哲学家致力于将哲学科学化，哲学的科学性体现在**体系化**，于是此时大量庞大哲学体系被建立。
   2. `培根`认为经验和理性的分离是错误的，应该将二者结合起来，但自身并没有为此作出多少贡献。
   3. `笛卡尔`将尚未清晰认识的所有概念悬置，提出“我思故我在”，成为现代哲学的开端，确立了理性的地位。
   4. `笛卡尔`的二元论难题，区分了主体、客体，心灵、物质，使之后的近代哲学（康德、黑格尔）奠定了基调。


Here is a professional, systematic list of major **paradigm shifts in the history of philosophy**, organized chronologically and thematically. Each represents a fundamental transformation in the **questions asked**, **methods used**, and **assumptions held** by philosophers.

---

### 1. **Mythos to Logos (Ancient Greece, \~6th century BCE)**

**Shift**: From mythological explanations of the cosmos to rational inquiry.

* **Key Figures**: Thales, Anaximander, Heraclitus, Pythagoras
* **Transformation**: Natural phenomena were no longer explained by gods and myths but through reasoned argument and observation.
* **Significance**: Birth of **natural philosophy** and the **principle of sufficient reason**—a foundational moment for all Western philosophical inquiry.

---

### 2. **Socratic Turn (5th–4th century BCE)**

**Shift**: From cosmology to ethics and human-centered inquiry.

* **Key Figures**: Socrates, Plato, Aristotle
* **Transformation**: Emphasis moved from understanding the universe to understanding the self, virtue, and the good life.
* **Significance**: Philosophy became reflective, dialogical, and normative; introduced dialectics and systematic logic.

---

### 3. **Medieval Integration of Theology and Philosophy (\~4th–13th century CE)**

**Shift**: Synthesis of Christian (and later Islamic and Jewish) theology with classical philosophy.

* **Key Figures**: Augustine, Aquinas, Avicenna, Maimonides
* **Transformation**: Use of reason to defend and elaborate religious doctrine; emphasis on metaphysics and divine order.
* **Significance**: Created Scholasticism—rigorous logical systematization of faith; also introduced the problem of **faith vs. reason**.

---

### 4. **Renaissance Humanism and the Rebirth of Secular Inquiry (14th–16th century)**

**Shift**: Revival of classical texts and emphasis on human dignity, empirical inquiry, and individual reason.

* **Key Figures**: Erasmus, Pico della Mirandola, Machiavelli
* **Transformation**: Decline of theological dominance; reorientation toward political, moral, and aesthetic life in this world.
* **Significance**: Paved the way for modern science, critical thinking, and secular philosophy.

---

### 5. **Rationalism and Empiricism (17th–18th century)**

**Shift**: Emergence of epistemology as central problem; split between rational deduction and sensory experience.

* **Key Figures**: Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz (rationalists); Locke, Berkeley, Hume (empiricists)
* **Transformation**: Reframing philosophy around the **conditions of knowledge** rather than metaphysical systems.
* **Significance**: Set stage for **Kantian synthesis** and **modern epistemology**.

---

### 6. **Kantian Revolution (Late 18th century)**

**Shift**: From metaphysical realism to **transcendental idealism**.

* **Key Figure**: Immanuel Kant
* **Transformation**: Claimed the mind plays an active role in shaping experience; knowledge is structured by **categories of understanding**.
* **Significance**: Created modern epistemology; shifted philosophy toward **conditions of possibility for experience**.

---

### 7. **German Idealism to Existentialism (19th–20th century)**

**Shift**: From abstract system-building to focus on human freedom, subjectivity, and lived experience.

* **Key Figures**: Hegel, Schopenhauer → Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Sartre
* **Transformation**: Emphasis on alienation, will, authenticity, and existential anxiety.
* **Significance**: Responded to mechanistic science and Enlightenment optimism with more **phenomenological and existential** concerns.

---

### 8. **Linguistic Turn (Early–Mid 20th century)**

**Shift**: From consciousness and metaphysics to **language** as the medium of thought and meaning.

* **Key Figures**: Frege, Wittgenstein, Russell, Austin, Quine
* **Transformation**: Language seen as central to philosophical problems; logic and ordinary language analysis became dominant.
* **Significance**: Redefined philosophy’s method and scope, especially in analytic tradition.

---

### 9. **Post-Structuralism and Critical Theory (Mid–Late 20th century)**

**Shift**: From structural universals to **power, discourse, and historicity**.

* **Key Figures**: Foucault, Derrida, Adorno, Habermas, Butler
* **Transformation**: Critique of Enlightenment reason, subjectivity, and metaphysical binaries; focus on social constructs and marginal voices.
* **Significance**: Deepened philosophical attention to **ideology, language, gender, race, and institutional power**.

---

### 10. **Pragmatic and Interdisciplinary Turns (Late 20th–21st century)**

**Shift**: From foundationalism to **practice-oriented, pluralistic, and interdisciplinary** approaches.

* **Key Figures**: Dewey, Rorty, Putnam, Nussbaum, Latour
* **Transformation**: Emphasis on philosophy's role in democratic life, practical consequences, and entanglement with science, technology, and ethics.
* **Significance**: Reoriented philosophy toward **public engagement**, ethics, applied problems, and **global perspectives**.

Below is a concise—but academically rigorous—tour of the pivotal *paradigm shifts* that have reorganised the discipline of philosophy.  A “paradigm shift,” following Kuhn, is not just the arrival of new thinkers but a wholesale change in what counts as a legitimate philosophical problem, what counts as an admissible method, and what counts as a satisfactory answer.

| #      | Paradigm shift                                                                  | Catalytic context & core novelty                                                                                                                                                        | Resulting re-orientation of the field                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**  | **From Mythos to Logos (c. 6th century BCE)**                                   | Early Greek *physiologoi* (Thales, Anaximander) rejected genealogical myth in favour of rational, impersonal explanation.                                                               | *Philosophy becomes a self-conscious, argumentative inquiry focused on *archê* (principle) and *logos* (reason), creating the template for systematic epistemology and metaphysics.*            |
| **2**  | **The Socratic-Platonic Turn (late 5th – 4th century BCE)**                     | Socrates’ ethical focus and Plato’s invention of dialectic and ontology of Forms shifted inquiry from natural cosmology to questions of virtue, knowledge and the structure of reality. | *Ethics and epistemology become internal—about justification and conceptual analysis; metaphysics gains an abstract, normative dimension.*                                                      |
| **3**  | **Christianisation of Greek Thought (3rd – 6th centuries CE)**                  | Church Fathers and late Platonists re-interpreted Greek categories through Christian theology (Augustine, Boethius).                                                                    | *Metaphysics and ethics integrate doctrinal concerns; philosophy becomes an ancilla theologiae (“handmaid of theology”), setting the stage for medieval scholasticism.*                         |
| **4**  | **Scholastic Synthesis & **“Two-Truths” Methodology** (11th – 14th centuries)** | Recovery of Aristotle via Arabic sources plus university institutionalisation (Aquinas, Scotus, Ockham).                                                                                | *Systematic disputation, refined logic, and the nature–grace distinction frame questions; metaphysics centres on essence/existence, universals, and divine attributes.*                         |
| **5**  | **The Humanist & Scientific Revolutions (15th – 17th centuries)**               | Renaissance philology (Valla, Erasmus) and mathematised physics (Copernicus, Galileo, Descartes).                                                                                       | *Epistemic authority shifts from commentary on Scripture/Aristotle to empirical test and mathematical demonstrability; scepticism and methodical doubt become central.*                         |
| **6**  | **Kant’s “Copernican Revolution” (1781)**                                       | *Critique of Pure Reason* reframes metaphysics as the study of conditions of possible experience, not of things-in-themselves.                                                          | *Transcendental philosophy replaces both rationalist dogmatism and empiricist scepticism; synthetic-a-priori judgments, autonomy, and the subject’s constitutive role become pivotal.*          |
| **7**  | **Hegelian & Post-Hegelian Historicism (1807 →)**                               | Hegel’s *Phenomenology* positions reason as historically unfolding, taken further by Marx, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche.                                                                      | *Truth becomes temporal, socially mediated, or perspectival; system-building yields to genealogy, critique of ideology, and existential concern.*                                               |
| **8**  | **The Analytic / Linguistic Turn (Frege 1879 → mid-20th c.)**                   | Frege’s Begriffsschrift, Russell’s logicism, and later Wittgenstein’s language-games recast philosophical problems as problems of language and logical form.                            | *Rigorous formal analysis, clarity, and argumentative minimalism take precedence; metaphysics is rehabilitated via modal logic and language-based ontology.*                                    |
| **9**  | **Phenomenology & Hermeneutics (Husserl 1900 →)**                               | Reaction to psychologism and scientism—“to the things themselves.”                                                                                                                      | *Intentional consciousness, lifeworld, and horizon of meaning dominate continental inquiry; interpretation (Gadamer, Ricoeur) displaces explanation as the basic task.*                         |
| **10** | **Post-Structuralism & Post-Modern Critique (1960s →)**                         | Structural linguistics, Foucauldian archaeology, Derridean deconstruction undermine foundationalism and stable subjectivity.                                                            | *Knowledge/power nexus, différance, discourse analysis challenge notions of universal reason; meta-narratives are suspected, opening space for feminist, queer and post-colonial philosophies.* |
| **11** | **Naturalistic & Cognitive Turns (late-20th c.)**                               | Advances in cognitive science, evolutionary biology, and AI (Quine, Churchland, Dennett).                                                                                               | *Philosophy realigns with empirical sciences, emphasising embodied cognition, computational theories of mind, and explanatory continuity from physics to ethics.*                               |
| **12** | **Global & Decolonial Re-Orientation (21st century)**                           | Critique of Eurocentrism, recovery of non-Western traditions (African Sage, Confucian revival, Amerindian relational ontology).                                                         | *Epistemic pluralism and intercultural dialogue reshape canonical boundaries; *philosophy* becomes a comparative practice sensitive to power, identity, and locality.*                          |

### Professional Observations

1. **Methodological realignment is the common denominator.**  Each shift redefines *how* arguments are to be made—mythic narrative → dialectic, Scripture → reason, language → formal logic, local experience → global pluralism.
2. **Institutional catalysts matter.**  The rise of the medieval university, the printing press, 19th-century research seminar, and today’s transnational networks structured which questions could even be asked.
3. **Paradigms overlap rather than simply replace.**  Medieval metaphysics co-exists with Kantian critique; analytic precision now negotiates with phenomenological description and decolonial critique.
4. **Future trajectories.**  Synthetic philosophy between AI, neuroscience and ethics, and planetary-scale ecological thinking (e.g., *Gaia*, *Anthropocene* discourse) may constitute the next paradigm threshold.

This mapping is necessarily schematic, but it captures the pivotal moments when philosophy re-founded its basic self-conception—what it studies, why it is valuable, and how rational inquiry ought to proceed.
