## 1 Basic Tools for Argument 论证的基本工具

### 1.1 Arguments, premises, and conclusions 论证、前提、结论

Philosophy is for nit‐pickers. That’s not to say it is a trivial pursuit. Far from it. Philosophy addresses some of the most important questions human beings ask themselves. The reason philosophers are nit‐pickers is that **they are commonly concerned with the ways in which the claims and beliefs people hold about the world either are or are not rationally supported, usually by rational argument**. Because their concern is serious, it is important for philosophers to demand attention to detail. People reason in a variety of ways using a number of techniques, some legitimate and some not. Often one can discern the difference between good and bad reasoning only if one scrutinises the **content and structure** of arguments with supreme and uncompromising diligence.

哲学是吹毛求疵者的学科。这并不是说它是一个微不足道的追求。恰恰相反，哲学解决了人类提出的一些最重要的问题。哲学家之所以吹毛求疵，是因为**他们通常关心人们对世界所持的观点和信仰是否在理性上得到支持，通常通过理性论证。**由于他们的关注是严肃的，因此哲学家必须要求注意细节。人们以多种方式推理，使用许多技术，有些是合法的，有些则不是。通常，只有在对论证的**内容和结构**进行极其仔细的审查后，才能辨别出良好推理和糟糕推理之间的区别。

#### Argument and inference

What, then, is an ‘argument’ proper? For many people, an argument is a contest or conflict between two or more people who disagree about something. An argument in this sense might involve shouting, name‐calling, and even a bit of shoving. It might also – but need not – include reasoning.

那么，什么是“正式的论证”？对许多人来说，论证是一场争论或冲突，涉及两个或更多的人对某事持不同意见。这种意义上的论证可能包括大喊大叫、辱骂，甚至有时推搡。它可能也包括推理，但不一定包括。

  - shout / ʃaʊt / vi.叫嚷，大声说；呼叫，喊叫；呼唤，呼喊（以引起注意）；大声吼叫使……住口（或讲话被淹没）（shout sb. down）；将嗓子喊哑；<英> 张扬（shout about）；明确无误地指出（或表示）；<澳新，非正式>（在酒吧、餐厅等）请人喝饮料（或吃东西）；使用大写字母（写电子邮件，表示生气） n.（愤怒、害怕、激动等的）呼喊，喊叫声；<英，非正式> 请客的酒，轮到买酒请客；<英，非正式> 紧急召集消防队（或警察）的叫喊声
  - name-calling n.骂人，中伤
  - shove / ʃʌv / v.猛推，乱挤；连推带挤地走；<非正式> 随便放置，乱放（某物）；<非正式>移动身体，挪动身体（以腾出地方）；<非正式>去他的，让……见鬼 n.猛推

Philosophers, in contrast, use the term ‘argument’ in a very precise and narrow sense. For them, an argument is the most basic complete unit of reasoning – an atom of reasoning. An ‘argument’ understood this way is an inference from one or more starting points (truth claims called a ‘premise’ or ‘premises’) to an end point (a truth claim called a ‘conclusion’). All arguments require an inferential movement of this sort. For this reason, arguments are called discursive.

Argument vs explanation
‘Arguments’ are to be distinguished from ‘explanations’. A general rule to keep in mind is that arguments attempt to demonstrate that something is true, while explanations attempt to show how something is true. For example, consider encountering an apparently dead woman. An explanation of the woman’s death would undertake to show how it happened. (‘The existence of water in her lungs explains the death of this woman.’) An argument would undertake to demonstrate that the person is in fact dead (‘Since her heart has stopped beating and there are no other vital signs, we can conclude that she is in fact dead.’) or that one explanation is better than another (‘The absence of bleeding from the laceration on her head combined with water in the lungs indicates that this woman died from drowning and not from bleeding.’)

The place of reason in philosophy
It’s not universally realised that reasoning comprises a great deal of what philosophy is about. Many people have the idea that philosophy is essentially about ideas or theories about the nature of the world and our place in it that amount just to opinions. Philosophers do indeed advance such ideas and theories, but in most cases their power, their scope, and the characteristics that distinguish them from mere opinion stem from their having been derived through rational argument from acceptable premises. Of course, many other regions of human life also commonly involve reasoning, and it may sometimes be impossible to draw clean lines demarcating philosophy from them. (In fact, whether or not it is possible to demarcate philosophy from non‐philosophy is itself a matter of heated philosophical debate!)

The natural and social sciences are, for example, fields of rational inquiry that often bump up against the borders of philosophy (especially in inquiries into the mind and brain, theoretical physics, and anthropology). But theories composing these sciences are generally determined through certain formal procedures of experimentation and reflection to which philosophy has little to add. Religious thinking sometimes also enlists rationality and shares an often‐disputed border with philosophy. But while religious thought is intrinsically related to the divine, sacred, or transcendent – perhaps through some kind of revelation, article of faith, or ritualistic practice – philosophy, by contrast, in general is not.

Of course, the work of certain prominent figures in the Western philosophical tradition presents decidedly non‐rational and even anti‐rational dimensions (for example, that of Heraclitus, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Derrida). We will examine the non‐argumentative philosophical methods of these authors in what follows of this book. Furthermore, many include the work of Asian (Confucian, Taoist, Shinto), African, Aboriginal, and Native American thinkers under the rubric of philosophy, even though they seem to make little use of argument and have generally not identified their work as philosophical.

But, perhaps despite the intentions of its authors, even the work of non‐standard thinkers involves rationally justified claims and subtle forms of argumentation too often missed. And in many cases, reasoning remains on the scene at least as a force with which thinkers must reckon.

Philosophy, then, is not the only field of thought for which rationality is important. And not all that goes by the name of philosophy is argumentative. But it is certainly safe to say that one cannot even begin to master the expanse of philosophical thought without learning how to use the tools of reason. There is, therefore, no better place to begin stocking our philosophical toolkit than with rationality’s most basic components, the subatomic particles of reasoning – ‘premises’ and ‘conclusions’.
