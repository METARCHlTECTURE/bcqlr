# Part 1 Ancient Philosophy

## 1 Beginnings: From Pythagoras to Plato

The history of philosophy does not begin with Aristotle, but the historiography of philosophy does. Aristotle was the first philosopher who systematically studied, recorded, and criticized the work of previous philosophers. In the first book of the Metaphysics he summarizes the teachings of his predecessors, from his distant intellectual ancestors Pythagoras and Thales up to Plato, his teacher for twenty years. To this day he is one of the most copious, and most reliable, sources of our information about philosophy in its infancy.

哲学史的开端并不在亚里士多德，但哲学史学的开端却始于他。亚里士多德是第一位系统地研究、记录并批评前人哲学工作的哲学家。在《形而上学》的第一卷中，他总结了从他远古的智识祖先毕达哥拉斯和泰勒斯直到柏拉图（他的老师长达二十年）的教义。直到今天，他仍然是我们获取关于哲学初期信息的最丰富、最可靠的来源之一。

### The Four Causes

Aristotle offers a classification of the earliest Greek philosophers in accordance with the structure of his system of the four causes. Scientific inquiry, he believed, was above all inquiry into the causes of things; and there were four different kinds of cause: the material cause, the efficient cause, the formal cause, and the final cause. To give a crude illustration of what he had in mind: when Alfredo cooks a risotto, the material causes of the risotto are the ingredients that go into it, the efficient cause is the chef himself, the recipe is the formal cause, and the satisfaction of the clients of his restaurant is the final cause. Aristotle believed that a scientific understanding of the universe demanded an inquiry into the operation in the world of causes of each of these kinds (Metaph. A 3. 983a24–b17).

亚里士多德根据他的四因理论对最早的希腊哲学家进行了分类。他认为科学探究首先是对事物原因的探究；而原因有四种不同类型：质料因、动力因、形式因和目的因。用一个粗略的例子来说明他的想法：当阿尔弗雷多烹饪意大利烩饭时，意大利烩饭的质料因是它的原料，动力因是厨师本人，食谱是形式因，而餐厅顾客的满意度则是目的因。亚里士多德认为，科学理解宇宙需要探讨这四种原因在世界中的运作（《形而上学》A3. 983a24–b17）。

Early philosophers on the Greek coast of Asia Minor concentrated on the material cause: they sought the basic ingredients of the world we live in. Thales and his successors posed the following question: At a fundamental level is the world made out of water, or air, or fire, or earth, or a combination of some or all of these? (Metaph. A 3. 983b20–84a16). Even if we have an answer to this question, Aristotle thought, that is clearly not enough to satisfy our scientific curiosity. The ingredients of a dish do not put themselves together: there needs to be an agent operating upon them, by cutting, mixing, stirring, heating, or the like. Some of these early philosophers, Aristotle tells us, were aware of this and offered conjectures about the agents of change and development in the world. Sometimes it would be one of the ingredients themselves—fire was perhaps the most promising suggestion, as being the least torpid of the elements. More often it would be some agent, or pair of agents, both more abstract and more picturesque, such as Love or Desire or Strife, or the Good and the Bad (Metaph. A 3–4. 984b8–31).

在小亚细亚希腊沿岸的早期哲学家集中于质料因：他们寻求我们所生活的世界的基本成分。泰勒斯和他的继任者提出了以下问题：从根本上说，世界是由水、空气、火、土中的哪一种，还是它们的某种组合构成的？（《形而上学》A3. 983b20–84a16）。即使我们对此问题有了答案，亚里士多德认为，这显然不足以满足我们的科学好奇心。菜肴的原料不会自己组合在一起：需要有一个代理人通过切割、混合、搅拌、加热等操作它们。亚里士多德告诉我们，一些早期的哲学家意识到了这一点，并提出了关于世界变化和发展的代理人的猜想。有时，这些代理人会是其中的一种成分——火也许是最有希望的建议，因为它是元素中最不懈怠的。更常见的是一些更加抽象和生动的代理人，诸如爱或欲望、冲突、善与恶等（《形而上学》A3–4. 984b8–31）。

Meanwhile in Italy—again according to Aristotle—there were, around Pythagoras, mathematically inclined philosophers whose inquiries took quite a different course. A recipe, besides naming ingredients, will contain a lot of numbers: so many grams of this, so many litres of that. The Pythagoreans were more interested in the numbers in the world’s recipe than in the ingredients themselves. They supposed, Aristotle says, that the elements of numbers were the elements of all things, and the whole of the heavens was a musical scale. They were inspired in their quest by their discovery that the relationship between the notes of the scale played on a lyre corresponded to different numerical ratios between the lengths of the strings. They then generalized this idea that qualitative differences might be the upshot of numerical differences. Their inquiry, in Aristotle’s terms, was an inquiry into the formal causes of the universe (Metaph. A 5. 985b23–986b2).

与此同时，在意大利——再根据亚里士多德的说法——围绕毕达哥拉斯有一些数学倾向的哲学家，他们的探究走上了完全不同的道路。一个食谱除了列出成分外，还会包含很多数字：多少克这个，多少升那个。毕达哥拉斯学派更感兴趣的是世界食谱中的数字，而不是成分本身。亚里士多德说，他们认为数字的元素是万物的元素，整个宇宙是一个音阶。他们的探索受到发现琴弦长度之间的不同数比对应音阶中的音符关系的启发。他们随后将这一思想概括为定性差异可能是数量差异的结果。在亚里士多德的术语中，他们的探究是对宇宙形式因的探究（《形而上学》A5. 985b23–986b2）。

Coming to his immediate predecessors, Aristotle says that Socrates preferred to concentrate on ethics rather than study the world of nature, while Plato in his philosophical theory combined the approaches of the schools of both Thales and Pythagoras. But Plato’s Theory of Ideas, while being the most comprehensive scientific system yet devised, seemed to Aristotle—for reasons that he summarizes here and develops in a number of his treatises—to be unsatisfactory on several grounds. There were so many things to explain, and the Ideas just added new items calling for explanation: they did not provide a solution, they added to the problem (Metaph. A 5. 990b1 ff.).

谈到他的直接前辈们，亚里士多德说苏格拉底更倾向于关注伦理学而不是研究自然界，而柏拉图在他的哲学理论中结合了泰勒斯学派和毕达哥拉斯学派的方法。但柏拉图的理念论，尽管是迄今为止最全面的科学体系，在亚里士多德看来——原因在此作简要总结并在他的多部著作中展开——在多个方面是不令人满意的。有那么多东西需要解释，而理念仅仅是增加了需要解释的新项目：它们没有提供解决方案，反而增加了问题（《形而上学》A5. 990b1 ff.）。

Most dissertations that begin with literature searches seek to show that all work hitherto has left a gap that will now be filled by the author’s original research. Aristotle’s Metaphysics is no exception. His not too hidden agenda is to show how previous philosophers neglected the remaining member of the quartet of causes: the final cause, which was to play a most significant role in his own philosophy of nature (Metaph. A 5. 988b6–15). The earliest philosophy, he concluded, is, on all subjects, full of babble, since in its beginnings it is but an infant (Metaph. A 5. 993a15–17).

大多数以文献检索开始的论文都试图表明，所有以前的工作都留下了一个现在将由作者原创研究填补的空白。亚里士多德的《形而上学》也不例外。他的潜在议程是展示前任哲学家忽视了四因理论的剩余成员：目的因，这在他的自然哲学中将发挥最重要的作用（《形而上学》A5. 988b6–15）。他总结说，最早的哲学，在所有主题上，都充满了幼稚，因为它在其开端时不过是个婴儿（《形而上学》A5. 993a15–17）。

A philosopher of the present day, reading the surviving fragments of the earliest Greek thinkers, is impressed not so much by the questions they were asking, as by the methods they used to answer them. After all, the book of Genesis offers us answers to the four causal questions set by Aristotle. If we ask for the origin of the first human being, for instance, we are told that the efficient cause was God, that the material cause was the dust of the earth, that the formal cause was the image and likeness of God, and that the final cause was for man to have dominion over the fish of the sea, the fowl of the air, and every living thing on earth. Yet Genesis is not a work of philosophy.

当代的哲学家阅读早期希腊思想家的现存片段时，印象更深的不是他们提出的问题，而是他们用来回答问题的方法。毕竟，《创世纪》为亚里士多德提出的四因问题提供了答案。例如，如果我们问第一个人类的起源，我们被告知动力因是神，质料因是地上的尘土，形式因是神的形象和样式，而目的因是让人类统治海中的鱼、空中的鸟和地上的一切活物。然而《创世纪》并不是一部哲学作品。

On the other hand, Pythagoras is best known not for answering any of the Aristotelian questions, but for proving the theorem that the square on the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is equal in area to the sum of the squares on the other two sides. Thales, again, was believed by later Greeks to have been the first person to make an accurate prediction of an eclipse, in the year 585 BC. These are surely achievements in geometry and astronomy, not philosophy.

另一方面，毕达哥拉斯最著名的不是回答任何亚里士多德的问题，而是证明了直角三角形斜边上的平方等于其他两边的平方之和。泰勒斯也被后来的希腊人认为是第一个在公元前585年准确预测日食的人。这些无疑是几何学和天文学的成就，而非哲学。

The fact is that the distinction between religion, science, and philosophy was not as clear as it became in later centuries. The works of Aristotle and his master Plato provide a paradigm of philosophy for every age, and to this day anyone using the title ‘philosopher’ is claiming to be one of their heirs. Writers in twenty-first-century philosophy journals can be seen to be using the same techniques of conceptual analysis, and often to be repeating or refuting the same theoretical arguments, as are to be found in the writings of Plato and Aristotle. But in those writings there is much else that would not nowadays be thought of as philosophical discussion. From the sixth century BC onwards elements of religion, science, and philosophy ferment together in a single cultural cauldron. From our distance in time philosophers, scientists, and theologians can all look back to these early thinkers as their intellectual forefathers.

事实上，宗教、科学和哲学之间的区别并不像后来世纪那样明确。亚里士多德和他的老师柏拉图的著作为每个时代提供了哲学的范例，至今任何使用“哲学家”头衔的人都声称是他们的继承人。21世纪哲学期刊中的作者可以看到，他们在使用相同的概念分析技术，并且经常重复或反驳柏拉图和亚里士多德著作中的相同理论论点。但是在这些著作中，还有很多不被认为是哲学讨论的内容。从公元前六世纪开始，宗教、科学和哲学的元素在一个文化大熔炉中一起发酵。从我们这个时代来看，哲学家、科学家和神学家都可以将这些早期思想家视为他们的智识祖先。
