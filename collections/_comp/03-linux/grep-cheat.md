`grep` is a command-line utility in Unix and Linux systems used to search for specific patterns or text within files. Its name stands for `Global Regular Expression Print`. grep is powerful and commonly used for text processing, system administration, and searching logs or codebases.

### Basic Syntax and Options

```bash
grep [options] pattern [file...]
```

| Option        | Description                                   |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `-i`          | Ignore case (case-insensitive search)        |
| `-v`          | Invert match (show lines that do **not** match)|
| `-r` or `-R`  | Recursive search through directories         |
| `-l`          | Print file names with matches (not the matches themselves) |
| `-n`          | Print line numbers alongside matches         |
| `-c`          | Print count of matching lines                |
| `-w`          | Match whole words only                       |
| `-x`          | Match entire line                            |
| `--color`     | Highlight matched text                       |
| `-e`          | Specify multiple patterns (useful for OR logic) |
| `-f`          | Read patterns from a file                    |
| `-o`          | Print only matched parts of a line           |
| `-q`          | Quiet mode (no output, returns exit status)  |
| `-m [num]`    | Stop reading after `[num]` matches           |
