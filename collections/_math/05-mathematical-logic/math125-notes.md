## Introduction

### Main Goals

To develop the foundations for all mathematics.

### Main Topics

Foundations of logic

Formal systsms

Axioms to develop all the mathematics

### Proof

What is a mathematical proof?
  - An argument that uses `logical steps` to show that a concrete `mathematical statement` follows form certain `assumptions`.
  - Proofs are made out of logical steps.
  - But how to be explicit about **which logical steps we are allowed to use**?

`Hilbert's Program (1900)`:
  - **Trying to find a formal system for mathematics where all true statements can be proved in a purely formal and syntactical way**, that only involves manipulating symbols, following certain rules in a purely mechanical way, without having to even know what the symbols mean.

The result is `formal systems`, which consists of 3 parts: 
  - a language,
  - a set of rules,
  - a list of axioms.

Formal systems can:
  - provide a solid foundation for mathematics.
  - be able to study proofs, theorems, and Constructions **as mathematical objects**.
  - play with computers, namely, `computer verification of proof`, `computer assistence for proofs`.

What is a `formal language`?
  - Consists of 2 parts: symbols and grammers
  - Complete.

What are rules?
  - Logical Thinking when writing proofs.
  - Complete.

What are Axioms？
  - They are statements that describe the very basic behaviour of numbers, sets, or whatever you're working with. They are used as assumptions in proofs.
  - They are so basic that you cannot and don't need to prove, that is, **they are supposed to be obviously TRUE**.
  - Incomplete.

Words
  - edifice [ˈedɪfɪs] n.大厦；宏伟建筑
  - subjectivity n.主观性；主观主义
  - contradiction [ˌkɒntrəˈdɪkʃ(ə)n] n.矛盾；反驳；否定
  - stand on a strong footing 站稳脚跟
  - follow from 由……引起：指某个结果是由某个原因或前提所导致的
