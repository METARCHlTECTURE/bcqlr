title: Master all Computer Languages in One Shot
---

## We'll Start at Once, No Preface

Let's establish this great goal with 2 topics:
  - why do the majority of programmers believe that it's impossible to master all programming languages, as a result, they should focus on practicing the well-chosen one, pretend they've made the most intelligent choice, argue endlessly with other programmers, and look down on them.
  - how is it possible to master all computer languages in one shot?

The answers to these questions are more related to psychology and epistemology than computer science or learning skills - so story time. About 2000 years ago, people firmly belived in the geocentric theory, which posited that all the planets and the Sun in our solar system orbit around the Earth on which we stand.

However astronomers found that building a mathematical model to explain and predict the movement of these celestial bodies is very difficult to build due to its complexity. At present we all know our solar system is quite simple, with every planet tracing circles in space. (Of course, the gravitational influence of other planets or satellites on the planet and the curvature of space are neglected because they are not obvious.) One more thing, Kepler and Isaac Newton's laws are even simpler.

**That's the power of multiple perspectives, a high-level view and abstraction**. Firstly, planets with magma, rocks and atmospheres are not considered by, what is used are point masses and ghostly forces. The differences between Earth and Jupipter, are represented by just a few numbers. When considering such matters, they are regarded as the same type of thing. Secondly, using the Sun, rather than the Earth, as the center of planetary motion greatly reduced the amount of thought and effort required for humans to find the laws of motion.

It should be noted that the heliocentric model is not only simpler but also more fundamental, as the reason for planetary motion largely stems from the Sun's mass. However, if the situation were reversed and the geocentric model were simpler, the heliocentric model would still be more fundamental, there is enough reason to believe that humans would use the simpler geocentric model to understand the heliocentric model. Just as we first use classical mechanics to gain a foundational understanding before studying relativistic mechanics.

We can do the same when learning programming languages, by adopting multiple perspectives a high-level view and applying abstraction.
